    "## 4. Deep dive into the *traffic problem* in Austin using the *Term Wikifier* and *Term Relater* services\n",
    "As we've seen in the 2016 results, that the traffic problem in Austin is significant. In this section we will use the *Term Wikifier* and *Term Relater* services to select a subset of the sentences related to the *Traffic* topic and run *Key Point Analysis* over them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *Term Wikifier* service runs over sentences and identifies the Wikipedia concepts that are referenced by phrases in the sentence text.  Concepts correspond to Wikipedia articles.  Each occurance of a concept in the sentence is called a *mention*.  For example, the sentence \"My car insurance went up 20% due to vehicle thefts and burglary\" mentions three Wikipedia concepts: The phrase \"car insurance\" is mapped to the concept *Vehicle insurance*; the phrase \"vehicle thefts\" is mapped to the concept *Motor vehicle theft* and the phrase \"burglary\" is mapped to the concept *Burglary*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Term Relater* service runs over pairs of Wikipedia concepts and scores how closely these concepts are related.  For example, the *Car* concept is very related to the *Traffic* concept but the *Cat* concept is not very related to the *Traffic* concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the *Term Wikifier* to extract all mentions in all sentences; then use the *Term Relater* to select a subset of these mentions which are related to the 'Traffic' concept; then select all sentences that have mentions related to the 'Traffic' concept; and finally run *Key Point Analysis* over them. Running over these sentences will create key points specifically to the traffic problem in Austin and expose insights and suggestions related to it."

    "In this tutorial, we showed how *Key Point Analysis* can provide you with detailed insights over survey data right out of the box - significantly reducing the effort required by a data scientist to analyze the data.  We also demonstrated how key point analysis over unstructured text can be combined with available structured information, to provide new views over the data.   Finally, we showed how utilizing of additional Project Debater text analysis services such as *Argument Quality*, *Term Wikifier* , and *Term Relater* can further improve the quality of the results."
