Going over thousands of comments is prohibitively expensive.  Existing automated approaches are often limited to identifying recurring phrases or concepts and the overall sentiment toward them, but do not provide detailed or actionable insights. \n",

When we want to provide the key points and match all the sentences to them we can pass key_points parameter: **run_param['key_points'] = [...]**. This enables a mode of work named human-in-the-loop where we first automatically extract key points, then we manually edit them (refine non-perfect key points, remove duplicated and add missing ones) and then run again, this time providing the edited keypoints as a given set of key points.\n",
    "* It is also possible to provide key points and let KPS add additional missing key points. To do so pass the key points to the key_point_candidates parameter: **run_param['key_point_candidates'] = [...]** (see Section 6.2 for an elaborated example).\n",
    "* Change the lengths of the required key points and the sentences participating in the summarization.\n",
    "* Change the minimal number of required matching sentences per key point. \n",
    "* The **mapping_policy** is used when mapping all sentences to the final key points: the default value is **NORMAL**. Changing to **STRICT** will cause only the sentence and key point pairs with very high matching confidence to be considered matched, increasing precision but potentially decreasing coverage. Changing it to **LOOSE** will do the opposite and match pairs with lower confidene. \n",

    "### 4.5 Add stance analysis to the summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In many usecases (surveys, customer feedback, etc.) the comments have positive and/or negative stances, and it is useful to create a KPS on each stance seperatly. Most stance detection models don't perform too well on survey data since the comments have many \"suggestions\" in them. These suggestions tend to be classified by the models as positives, while the user suggests a point for improvement. For that end we trained a stance-model that handles suggestions well and classifies each sentence as either 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral' or 'Suggestion'. We treat Suggestions as negatives and run two separate summarizations, first over 'Positive' sentences (pro) and second over 'Negative' and 'Suggestions' sentences (con).\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate separate positive/negative key points that show clearly what works well and what needs to be improved.\n",
    "* Filters-out neutral sentences that usually don't contain valuable information.\n",
    "* Helps the matching model avoid stance mistakes (matching a positive sentence to a negative key point and vice-versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, we might want to run over a single stance. For example, if we are only interested in points for improvement.\n",
    "In order to run for each stance seperately, use the **stance** parameter in **run_kps_job**. the options are either \"pro\", \"con\", or \"no-stance\" (default). For example, to run only on the \"pro\" sentences, run **keypoints_client.run_kps_job(domain=domain, stance=\"pro\")**"

Another major benefit for this approach is run-time. 2016 data was already analyzed with these key points and now we only need to process the new data. The 2016 key points can be provided via the: **run_param['key_point_candidates'] = [...]** parameter, passing a list of strings, or we can use: **run_param['key_point_candidates_by_job_ids'] = [\\<job_id1\\>,...]** and provide a list of previous job_ids.

We also demonstrated key *key point Summarization* features such as how to modify the summarization parameters and increase coverage, how to use the stance-model and create per-stance results, how to incrementally add new data and how to compare between different subsets of the data.\n",
