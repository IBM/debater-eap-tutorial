    "# Using *Key Point Summarization* service for analyzing and finding insights in a survey data \n",
    "When you have a large collection of texts representing peopleâ€™s opinions (such as product reviews, survey answers or social media), it is difficult to understand the key issues that come up in the data. Going over thousands of comments is prohibitively expensive.  Existing automated approaches are often limited to identifying recurring phrases or concepts and the overall sentiment toward them, but do not provide detailed or actionable insights. \n",

    "The data we will use is [a community survey conducted in the city of Austin](https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Community-Survey/s2py-ceb7). In this survey, the citizens of Austin were asked \"If there was ONE thing you could share with the Mayor regarding the City of Austin (any comment, suggestion, etc.), what would it be?\". "

When we want to provide key points and match all sentences to these key points we can do so by passing them to the keypoints parameter: **run_param['key_points'] = [...]**. This enables a mode of work named human-in-the-loop where we first automatically extract key points, then we manually edit them (refine non-perfect key points, remove duplicated and add missing ones) and then run again, this time providing the edited keypoints as a given set of key points.\n",
    "* It is also possible to provide key points and let KPS add additional missing key points. To do so pass the key points to the key_point_candidates parameter: **run_param['key_point_candidates'] = [...]** (see section 5 for an elaborated example).\n",
    "* Change the lengths of the required key points and the sentences participating in the analysis.\n",
    "* The **mapping_policy** is used when mapping all sentences to the final key points: the default value is **NORMAL**. Changing to **STRICT** will cause only the sentence and key point pairs with very high matching confidence to be considered matched, increasing precision but potentially decreasing coverage. Changing it to **LOOSE** will do the opposite and match pairs with lower confidene. \n",

    "\n",
    "In many usecases (surveys, customer feedback, etc.) the comments have positive and/or negative stance, and it is usful to create a KPS analysis on each stance seperatly. Most stance detection models don't perform too well on survey data (also costumer feedbacks etc.) since the comments tend to have many \"suggestions\" in them, and the suggestions tend to appear as positive to the model while the user suggests to improve something that needs improvement. For that end we trained a stance-model that handles suggestions well and labels each sentence as 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral' and 'Suggestion'. We treat Suggestions as negatives and run two separate analysis, first over 'Positive' sentences (pro) and second over 'Negative' and 'Suggestions' sentences (con).\n",

    "We can now run a new analysis over all the data in the domain, as we did before, and automatically extract new key points. We can assume that some will be identical to the key points extracted on the 2016 data, some will be similar and some key points will be new.\n",

    "A better option is to run a new analysis but provide the keypoints from the 2016 analysis and let *Key Point Summarization* add new key points from the 2017 data if there are such. One benefit of this approach is that the new result will mostly use 2016 key point and we will be able to compare between them and view the trends. Another major benefit for this approach is run-time. 2016 data was already analyzed with these key points and since we have a cache in place, much of the computation can be avoided. The 2016 key points can be provided via the: **run_param['key_point_candidates'] = [...]** parameter, passing a list of strings, or we can use: **run_param['key_point_candidates_by_job_ids'] = [\\<job_id1\\>,...]** and provide a list of previous job_ids. KPS will take the key points from the jobs' result automatically.\n",

We can also use the incremental approach when running on both stances: we will need to provide the job_id of the positive analysis of 2016 in the run_params_pro and the job_id of negative analysis of 2016 in the run_params_con when running on all sentences from 2016+2017.\n",
