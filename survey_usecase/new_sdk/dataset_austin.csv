2,2016,"Maintenance of city facilities needs to be equitable across the city. We need to think long-term; Austin can't sustain it's current level of ""chic"" indefinitely. What are we going to do when the cool beautiful people move to a community with more shiny dime-store objects to lure them? Long after the current boom goes bust (and it always does) the rest of us real Austinites will still be here. It really is time to stop sacrificing the quality of life on the east side of town (or any of the  less-privileged parts of town) for the wants of those living in the wealthier areas. The differences from one neighborhood to the next are quite visible. Public transportation needs to be a primary issue, whether the numerous single-car drivers like it or not. In short, we need to find our way back to being both more humane and pragmatic.",9

359,2016,"First think I noticed when I moved from Portland, OR to Austin, it's how similar they are, for good and bad. Like Portland, the City of Austin does not seem to plan well for growth, and projects are often delayed and over budget. I expected better, being that there is a big difference in mentality between Oregon's government and Texas. I grew up in McAllen, TX, and I was always impressed on how McAllen, like other Texas cities, are always ahead of growth when it comes to road infrastructure. Austin, on the other had, shows such lack of planning and execution. The city is growing fast, while the road infrastructure is falling behind. Roads are poorly maintain. On top of that, density of neighborhoods are [purposely] increasing, putting pressure to existing road infrastructure. If this city were like McAllen, Slaughter Lane would already be finished all the way to Hwy. 183, with at least 4 lanes. Austin has likely wasted more money on studies and planning that what it would had cost to build it back in 2005. City leaders need to do a much better job keep up with growth. By the way, light rail made no difference in Portland to alleviate congestion -- and they spent billions on it and more in subsidies, every year.",2

That being said, and I do not attribute this to his mayoral time in office, our city road and highway system is in need of a major overhaul. The Mopac ""improvement"" project is really just a joke -- a variable rate toll lane is not going to solve our north/south traffic flow issues. As someone who lives right off of Mopac and Far West, I am fortunate to be able to get around most jams during the day, but when it comes to rush hour morning or evening, there is just no getting around Austin. I find it so disheartening that in this beautiful city, people that live north and south cannot meet up for a quick workout in the evenings or meet for dinner to catch up due to the extreme traffic problem. I know Mayor Adler doesn't have full control over state highway projects in Austin, but I would like for him to know I appreciate his efforts in expanding our city roads (whether that be through new traffic patterns, new lanes, bike/bus lanes, etc).",10

We took the bus to see the fireworks on 4th of July. When we exited Zilker park with hordes of people at the end of the display - we found all of the bus stops closed! There was no way to get home.

I feel afraid in my own home due to so many workers around watching my comings and goings. Additionally, I can't get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time and spend hours wasted away in traffic. This was a poorly planned project and to subject Mopac homeowners to this for 2+ years is appalling, especially given the taxes I pay for my little tiny house. I am a single mom,  RN of 40 years that raised two children in Austin. Thank goodness they are grown and do not live here to see the mess.  I have recently obtained my master's in nursing and am now a Nurse Practitioner. I will be moving to Haiti to work as a missionary and plan to keep my house for a while longer but if Austin does not improve the traffic situation and clean up around Mopac, I will leave and move to be with my children.

Pedestrians are at great risk, particularly children, and unrealistic speed limits reflect an Austin that no longer exists.

Ride-sharing changed that.  It was safe, affordable and a great option for a resident who might want to catch a band and have drinks....no drinking  and driving.

There seems to be a tendency within the city to compromise on these projects where the end result doesn't solve the original problem and still costs the city a large sum of money. Cases in point: The light rail system was built on 1960s technology (to save money) and didn't extend to the airport (to save money) and doesn't have parking lots near many of the stops (to save money) and is therefore useless to 90% of the people living in Austin while costing everyone in the city money. Further, the mopac extension of ONE lane (a toll lane) will do almost nothing to alleviate traffic while causing years of traffic delays. Further, for many of the lower income people who moved further from our city's center due to housing costs the variable priced toll could negate an hour or two of work in an eight hour work day which could make the toll lane prohibitively expensive.

We have to either outlaw them completely or create true off-street bikeways, and make them ride on sidewalks. Providing more bike lanes and dashed lanes is adding to the problem because drivers have no idea what the rules are, and neither do bicycles. Suddenly, tons of strange dotted lines have appeared at intersections and few people know what the hell to do. I'd really like to see more public transit and no bikes on streets. I know I sound like an ultra-conservative, but I'm actually ultra-liberal. It's just that we have to drive cars in this society, and something drastic needs to happen about bikes.",7

The Staff are wonderful and hard working and are trying to make the best environment  for seniors.

The Gas company did not transfer until 5 days later and I was charged 10 dollars per day by the complex for a total of 50 dollars. That is a lot of money on a fixed income. When I called the gas company  I was told that even though everyone is important that my gas was already turned on so the others were done first. Is this done to everyone? Not a good way to do business when there is no other choice. I love Austin and choose to live here but now that I am ageing it is getting more difficult to live here.

Here's where we are missing the mark on affordability:
-Our property tax base grows as a result of more housing for an increasing population
-The growing base provides the city with a larger pool of money to run the city
-The city increases spending to account for the larger pool
We offer incentives to companies to relocate to Austin. They bring more jobs and more people to Austin. Our tax base expands, but the average resident does not get a slice of that pie. Instead, we pay more and more. To be sure, it is nice that our property values increase, but we are not seeing the benefits of 'our share' being a smaller slice of a growing pie. The pie grows and somehow the costs of the cut for the average guy goes up anyway.

829,2016,"My neighborhood (Windsor Park) doesn't have very many sidewalks, yet a lot of people walk their dogs and take their kids and babies for walks on neighborhood streets without sidewalks anyway. Still, it would be really nice if the sidewalks that we do have could be more pedestrian-friendly. I am thinking specifically of Berkman Drive between the 290 frontage road and Briarcliff. There are a lot of bus stops on this stretch of Berkman, which is a main thoroughfare in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, there aren't really adequate trash bins for each of these bus stops. The ones that do exist often overflow, allowing trash to collect around the sidewalk and to blow into the front yards of houses (like mine) in close proximity to Berkman. Also, particularly the borders of the western side of Berkman, are often overgrown and not adequately mowed, so that the area of the sidewalk where you can actually walk is much narrower than it should be. I realize that this is a pretty trivial concern in the overall scheme of things, but I think clean streets really contribute to the well-being of neighborhoods. Citizens who walk more are healthier. Citizens who take the bus more have a smaller carbon footprint, and cleaner streets contribute to neighborhood pride and safer streets. I'd love to know how much the heavy city trash bins cost so that I could help my neighborhood raise money for some more. 
Overall, I am very happy with the efforts the City of Austin takes to conserve energy and water and to foster responsible growth, but I feel we still need to push harder for effective public transportation to the outer suburbs. We're a hot city and we're going to experience the effects of climate change in different ways than northern cities. I'd like to know we're doing everything we can to mitigate our carbon footprint on the environment. 
I obviously need to start going to city council meetings, but thank you for this opportunity to offer my feedback.

McNeil Drive for example has 3' weeds growing in the center blvd between 183 and the McNeil HS before they get mowed. Weeds are growing in the cracks of the non grass boulevard areas also. The weed roots damage masonry as they are looking bad. I see this Detroit type affect all over the city. This lack of maintenance makes Austin look run down. It seems like such an easy fix. Mow the grass and remove the weeds once a month. I know this takes money, but what a great visible way of showing our tax $$$ being used. Right now it looks like our tax dollars are NOT being used for this at all.  Simple monthly lawn maintenance would make Austin look like a well kept city. A pride thing.

BTW, is mine & my neighbors tax dollars paying them for running a year over project?  Michael Dell seems to be able to get things done very quickly up in his neighborhood.  That just never seems to happen in SW AUSTIN. This use to be such an AWESOME place to live but you just keep raising our taxes and allowing hundreds of new folks move into our Beautiful city everyday with NO traffic infrastructure vision in place. What is our city government doing with all this money? Something is just not working any more in what use to be one of the most fantastic cities in the country. You double the value of my property this past year yet I don't have street lights or sidewalks in my neighborhood. Could that be why crime is getting so bad?  It's so dark who can see the burglars. I'm very sad for my Beautiful Austin, you guys are doing something's or budgeting very poorly with all this tax money. Where is the accountability? You build roads that we agree we will pay for with tolls & you can't even get that right!  I would like to know where accountability comes in? Probably billions of dollars spent all over the city for contracts signed that run over but you folks or road construction folks are NEVER held accountable. So I guess they don't care if they complete these jobs on time or not. Us tax payers will make sure they still get paid every night!  I love being on MoPac parking lot returning home on a Sunday night from dropping off my grandkids in a SINGLE LANE OF TRAFFIC (after how many years of construction). Watch 6 guys standing around talking, smoking cigarettes figuring out what to do next I guess. Watching my hard earn money (taxes) being put to such a terrible waste. To say I am disillusioned with your governments poor decisions in my Austin, is an understatement!!  I am sure most long time residents and Austinites a like feel exactly the same way.

I find it interesting that there were questions in this survey about emergency responses and EMS.  I wonder how many citizens realize that MOST fire department responses are for medical emergencies, not fires.  I would like to understand why it makes sense to dispatch a large truck with a full complement of fire fighters to a medical emergency, which is then almost always followed by an EMS response.   If it's because EMS lacks the resources to respond to all medical emergencies quickly enough, then some of the resources now allocated to AFD need to be redirected to EMS.",9

1314,2016,"The city needs to play a stronger role in creating an Austin that everyone can afford to live in, not just the upper-middle class and rich. I recently was at a meeting w/ Neighborhood Housing and Community Development where they presented Austin's Housing Plan and more than half of the units (40k out of 75k) are slated to be Market Rate!....and this stat was under the heading ""10 Year¬†Affordable Housing¬†Goals¬†&¬†Targets"". Seriously!?! How does this happen!?! The market rate units have happened, have destroyed neighborhoods, and will continue to happen without NHCD's assistance. 
This is the reason why Austin currently has almost half the number of Black people here as when I was growing up. I honestly don't understand how this process went through any kind of thorough community engagement and this is the result we have. I think the solutions lie in recruiting a diverse city staff (especially in NHCD), hiring diverse consultants that are able to reach the people most impacted by the city's plans (even if that means holding public engagement events in cities like Manor, Elgin and Del Valle, which have been the recipients of our lower-income people of color), and again, putting our money where our mouth is. 
The city likes to think of itself as a liberal beacon of light, but the reality is that we are the most economically segregated metro area in the country AND the only city in the country with double-digit population growth and a declining Black population. If we want to walk the talk we need to invest as much time, resources, and energy in bringing back diversity as we do trying to attract tech companies and act cool.

When we moved here to a newly, fully renovated home in a nice neighborhood, we shortly discovered the house was infested with rats in the walls and attic.  Apparently it was a problem that could never get fully resolved bc of the tenacity of the rats to get back in to the home.  I soon learned how many friends and acquaintances (and in their personal experience) that the rat problem in people's homes is all too common and all too costly to eradicate. The City of Austin REALLY needs to implement the same type of chemical sterilization program that New York City and Chicago have implemented to control their rat problems.

Provide decent housing and jobs and people will feel good about themselves.  Way, way too much spent on a new library and there will be no place to park.  There is no parking now in Austin and then they tell us that our neighborhoods may get metered.  GREED is what drives the city not common sense and adequate services.  Too much money spent on music festivals, trash cleanup and catering to the young.  The senior centers are not even open much now because they want us to believe the city cannot afford them.

It serves a population that is affluent, i.e., flush with motor vehicles who don't need to use public transit, except for when they want to come downtown and drink, but not face charges of a DUI/DWI. Public transit is a must in the modern Austin. The failure of this city to provide a metro line to south Austin is mind-boggling. Furthermore, the city has failed to even provide a metro line for UT students, who are the largest demographic in this city that would benefit from a metro line. The metro line as it exists is not serving a tourist population, because it runs from Leander (which is too far for most tourists) to the convention center (which is not a tourist destination for anyone coming from north Austin). I urge you to push for stronger legislation for a metro line, no matter how strong the gas and oil lobby is, no matter what the city council says. We need it. Pedestrian deaths, traffic times - everything is getting worse without it. If you truly serve this city, if you truly are a representative for those who cannot represent themselves, then you'll help us address this grave problem.",3
1329,2016,"The cost for utilities (electric, water, waste water, gas, and trash) is so high that we may be moving to a more affordable city nearby.  Additionally, the droughts in the last 5-6 years were managed VERY poorly by the city resulting in a request for water conversation AND a significant increase in cost.  The messaging that we received from the city is that the majority of residence helped the Water Department have a successful conservation program, but the result is that we paid more for it.  The cost for gas is going up exponentially and I don't trust the city management or utility department about why.  
After dealing with 10 years of traffic issues I have given up on the City Management on choosing measures that will help reduce the amount of traffic on I-35, Mopac, or any of the major streets.  Even more, the need to propose and award projects to the businesses who donate the most money to the City Hall members and their election efforts is leading to more and more distrust within the community.  Also, the City's need to over-regulate has chased away two of the largest traffic congestion options - Uber and Lyft, shows that there is more of an interest in the City earning dollars on businesses in town instead of helping to resolve the problems.  Multiple TNCs have opened in town, but it has been 4 months since Uber & Lyft left town and the driving availability and cost of using the current TNCs is led more people to drive on their own, congest more traffic, take up more parking spots, or simply stay home where the city loses out on a LOT of tax dollars. 
None of the above complaints are new to the city, it's managers, and utility departments.  What matters is whether or not they decide to listen to the results of this survey.  If this data is not used to better our city and communities I will not be surprised, but will be disappointed nonetheless.",5

A huge example is the 'Push' for bicycle commuting, which families with small children, elder citizens, handicapped citizens, people that need to wear appropriate clothes to work, people who carry tools and machinery as part of their trade  and on and on...THESE people make up the vast group of commuters...They cannot ride a bike to work! Streets have been redesigned at great expense, and creation of less lanes for moving vehicle traffic, to be left unused daily by the intended bicycle users.
There are many other examples of poorly designed ideas for a community the size of our city.",10

1357,2016,The lack of affordable housing in Austin has pushed many of the original Austinites out of the city. The City of Austin caters to those that recently moved here and has not listened to those that were born and raised here. The family and kid friendly city no longer exist.,1

1366,2016,"The police are too reactive and authoritarian.  Police are to protect and serve and although my interactions have on the whole been satisfactory, there is low tolerance for unattached males in general.  Austin has become a more violent city and it's not clear if this is a response to the reactiveness of the police or if police are  reacting to a more violent city.  In general society has become more violent in the last 30 years and it reflects in the police and the populace.  Nevertheless, the police have a duty and obligation to operate on a higher standard of restraint in dealing with the populace.  That is something that needs to be more effectively addressed by the APD.",10

1375,2016,"The tax on homes should be based on what the owner paid for the house, not on how much the realtor could sell the house.  The  rising taxes cost/determination on my house is putting me into poverty.  My ability to support myself on my set retirement is in  serious jeopardy because of the unreasonable increases in property taxes. My mortgage is ""paid in Full.""  Now I continue to pay rent, called property tax, to continue to live in ""my house.""  The mortgage payment was fixed, taxes increase everyday and I have this slapped in my face every day.  My retirement is a fixed amount until I die. 
Please address this  systemic, out of control, evil, unkindness, money  sucking, taxing without representation on lifetime, homeowner senior citizens of Austin.   I was able/ allowed to buy the house based on my ability to pay the mortgage which we all know included the property taxes!   Now the property taxes are based on greed or should I say Systemic stealing or so called what the realtors say the property is selling for currently. The  enormous, out of control rising cost of property taxes in Austin, Texas, is sending  me into a  financial life style of poverty.

1393,2016,There is a big problem in Austin with people driving slow in the left (passing) lane. This holds up traffic tremendously. The left lane is supposed to be for passing ONLY and then people should move over. No one does this! It needs to be enforced and people need to be educated on this law. I also see people texting and driving constantly. You can spot them immediately because they drive like they are drunk. It's eradic and dangerous. This law also needs to be enforced better.,1

Why then, for the sake of growth, prosperity and infrastructure in general is there only ONE major freeway intersecting this fast-growing and fabulous city?

City managers and leaders are to blame for the mess for which we find ourselves relative to traffic woe's.

We always drive within the speed limit, but must now almost stop at each hump, to get over it.  It is wrecking our shocks, our brakes and our bodies.  It hurts.  It is so unpleasant to drive up Far West and now Mesa, that we are considering moving after 40 years!  We understand the need to control traffic, but it is a few speeders, and it seems some hefty tickets, which are also good revenue sources, would better serve the neighborhood.  We really HATE these hard humps.  Why not put in the more expensive pavement humps to help keep our neighborhoods a pleasant place to live and drive.  2.  We have one other concern about the exorbitant drainage fee.  We are older, living in a garden home community.  We have a 1000 square foot print on a very small lot.  A green belt surrounds us with lots of drainage, but we must pay the top fee because our lot is small.  We are retired.  This extra $20 a month on our utility bill for drainage, which is not a problem with the greenbelt and common areas, seem unfair.  Very unfair.

Over all I believe the intent of city management and employees is to do the best job they can for the community, but I believe we are in a storming phase with the lack of leadership in recent years with an unexperienced city council and lack of support for city civil servants.  
The special interest groups need to be held accountable, just like we hold those civil service employees who are employed with the city agencies and not be one sided as portrayed in the media. I would like every citizen treated equally, regardless of race, religion, age, sexual orientation, and/or wealth or lack there of; meaning serval things to include eliminating Austin being a sanctuary city and quit giving extra resources to special interest groups (i.e. criminals, sexually oriented persons, race, bicyclist, etc.) that only seek out and receive special provisions because of what group they are affiliated with, having little regard to negative impact it causes on their fellow citizens' concerns. I believe we are all equal in America and should not be given extra benefits for belonging too or associating with a particular interest group that someone who is not part of group does not receive. 
If things keep getting worse, I will end up leaving the city after 40+ years and retire in a environment that is inspired by community growth and commitment to one another, not one that is supporting criminals and people that do not contribute positively to the community.

2062,2017,"I am an owner of a couple of short term rental properties in town (one Type 1, in the duplex where I live, and another duplex -- Type 2 -- a block away from my home here in Duplex Nation).  I attended the hearings on the new regulations in 2016 and was disappointed in the results (particularly with regard to Type 2 properties), mainly because I believe (like many other STR owners who strictly adhere to the requirements set down by the city), that actors in good faith have been punished for the bad acts of a few.  And I absolutely believe the threat from STRs to city affordability has been overblown without any reasonable data backing it up and the STRS have been made a scapegoat for a complex problem that is more on the backs of property developers and a NIMBY-led city-wide resistance to increased density.  That said, I also absolutely oppose opening up the city to unregulated STR development like those bills the state has been considering the past session.  I felt the 3% cap worked well for Type 2 rentals at drawing a compromise between property rights and neighborhood integrity, and only failed to work where in high demand neighborhoods where unregistered STRs were allowed to operate with impunity.  Specifically, I'd like to see Type 2 rentals for good actors maintained WITH A CENSUS TRACT CAP similar to the one that was in place before the change in city regulations in 2016, but moreover, I would like the City of Austin to consider signing agreements with Airbnb, Homeaway, etc. to let them charge and pay the city hotel taxes UPFRONT, instead of leaving this to the STR owners.  As you may know, the state comptroller has recently done this with Airbnb and Airbnb now charges all Airbnb bookings in the state of Texas 6% HOT directly and pays the state on a quarterly basis.  I feel such an agreement would put all STRs on a level playing field (and would increase overall tax revenues for the city) by ensuring non-compliant STRs are forced to charge the taxes owed to the city.  I believe if the City of Austin signed these agreements with the STR booking platforms, revenues for the city would increase without needing to consider higher hotel occupancy taxes, which I understand is under consideration.  Finally, notwithstanding the STR issue that affects my family personally, I want to thank Mayor Adler for consistently taking the correct moral stance with so many of the issues facing this city; immigration, transgender issues, etc.  We are truly fortunate to have a mayor like Mr. Adler.",9

2087,2017,"I feel as though the only affordable place to live right now is in the Del Valle area, which is why I recently bought a home out there; however, I feel as though the residents of Del Valle often have to pay for Austin services but do not get any of the benefits from Austin.  There are no amenities, no shops, and no grocery stores, yet I recently heard that my property taxes may go up.  Why am I paying so much and getting so little?  Why are you taxing the poorest of your communities at the highest rate.  It might behoove you to tax those that are more wealthy and affluent.  It might behoove you to care a little more about Del Valle.   We matter too, and the community would appreciate it if you acted like we mattered.",2

2121,2017,"I miss my city. I look around and see strangers. I feel like people are invading our home with no respect to the Communities that existed here before their arrival. I see my diverse neighborhood becoming White washed. There is not enough support for poor people and people of color in this city. Not enough investment is made into honoring native citizens, not enough protections are provided. In my interactions with the police, I am treated like a criminal in my own neighborhood. Police show up with their hands on their guns in front of a child's birthday party. I mistakenly rang the wrong doorbell trying to find my child's friends home. Instead of interning me I was at the wrong house the resident called the police. Luckily one officer was upset about this as I was and informed the resident they could have just talked to me. But this is the reality now. People call the cops on you for knocking on their door.  Police presence doesn't make me feel safer. More crime now due to influx of money. The city needs to get out here, be in these streets, visit the pools in a summer day, go talk to the people at ARCH, come to the Eastside where the voices of poor people and people of color are still not being heard. Stop pandering to the affluent who are taking over our policies with their own needs because they can afford to show up. We are still here; your working class communities, your starving artists, your waiters, your fast food workers, your janitors, your teachers (!), your single parents, your high school educated, your formerly convicted, we all deserve to feel safe, we all deserve access to affordable homes, affordable childcare, affordable food. The needs of the rich and the needs of the poor are not the same. We don't need boutique stores and bars. We just want community spaces where everyone feels welcome, we want police who treat us with respect, we want local government who listens and tries harder. I'm tired of all that I'm seeing. But all that being said, I really appreciate the mayor's efforts to address the housing affordability crisis. We love our libraries and our pools, when they're open (why are there no lifeguards of color? It seems the aquatics Dept. could go into the schools and recruit). I love bulky trash day and I wish recycling was weekly but I love that the city makes efforts in these areas. I think we just need to better to care for the people. Enforcing codes and criminalizing minor offenses doesn't strengthen the community, it pits people against each other. We need to be mindful of racism inherent in our city systems. We need to train our civil servants how to unlearn their own bias. I wish we had the type of community policing where people recognized police, spoke with them, felt safe with them. But we know what's going on, here and everywhere, Austin needs to be on the forefront of change. We need to be trailblazing not falling in line and you have the right kind of people to do the work here. You have very engaged citizens building movements, reach out to these people, see them as allies. Thank you for your time.",9
2122,2017,I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS STANCE ON A SANCTUARY CITY THANK YOU,1
2123,2017,"I really like to recycle but since it is only picked up every other week, sometimes it is hard to get everything to fit, even though the bin is very large.

2126,2017,I support his views on Sanctuary Cities. The apartment here raise rent at every renewal and it is getting out of hand. We need rent control for the middle class as well as the poor.,10
2127,2017,I SUPPORT MAKING AREAS SAFER FOR PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLIST HOWEVER SOME OF THE BIKE LANES/CURBS INSTALLED DOWNTOWN MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR CARS TO EXIT WITHOUT HITTING THE BICYCLE LANE CURB UNLESS YOU MAKE A WIDE TURN INTO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE CURBS SHOULD BE CUT BACK AT PARKING GARAGE EXITS 301 CONGRESS EXIT AT 3RD ST,2

2130,2017,"I think some major focus should be placed on restoring the diversity in Austin. Gentrification has spread throughout Austin and pushed all minorities to the outskirts. Austin was labeled the embarrassing, #1 place where more black people left a city even though it's growing at remarkable rates. It's sad to see the previous Hispanic and black community that once was disappear. Everything has been replaced with chains and the removal of any culture. Austin is no longer 'weird', it is now white.",2
2131,2017,"I think that department head vacancies should be replaced with existing city employees.  Why spend all this money on a recruiting firm and hire an outsider not familiar with the city.  For instance, if the interim police chief is doing a good job, promote him to the police chief position.  Also, I think we should concentrate on our green belts and trim more trees to prevent fires and electrical outages.  Also, don't take away sick time or PTO time from dedicated city employees.",10

2134,2017,I think the city permitting department seriously needs an overhaul. It is notorious as being an obstruction to growth and many people I know in Austin would 100% agree. I have heard many stories of people being affected negatively by this department.,10

Where are my tax dollars at work?!",4
2143,2017,"I was born and raised here.   It feels as if we are being pushed out by out of state people.  This is causing a rise in property taxes, rent and housing costs.  This was done when large out of state businesses were allowed to move here and given tax incentives.  These big businesses brought their own people hiring very limited people from Austin.  Now they are taking over east Austin, raising taxes and pushing poor Hispanic/African American people further away from Austin.  We need to get back to that small town feeling.  I do not want this city ""California"".",8

I have seen older workers come in out of retirement, just to work no more than 5 - 10 years, and retire again. I have also noticed a lot of racial things, but to speak on it I feel that nothing is going to happen, so I just feel why waste my time reporting it.

2154,2017,I would ask that the Mayor continue to focus on providing access to affordable housing for both renters and residents wanting to buy homes.,9
2155,2017,I would ask the Mayor to PLEASE ask our state legislatures to focus MORE on public education finance reform than on bathroom bills.  Our children are our future and the Austin Ind. School District is struggling mightily bc of a lack of TRUE and CONCERTED attention to public school finance.  Way more citizens (children) are influenced by public education than any other single publicly funded need - give it the time and energy it deserves!!!!,8

Please represent the people who have been here, paid their dues, put sweat equity into creating the neighborhoods where people want to live. We are reasonable and understand change and growth is inevitable, we want smart, effective planning and zoning that works for the diverse community, not changes that only benefit developers and entitled outsiders who have no intentions of respecting or contributing to the community. Brentwood, Crestview, Allendale and surrounding neighborhoods want a place for everyone to raise kids and retire, not be pushed out by ridiculous taxes and greedy developers. Come prepared to really talk about the issues next time, your lack of answers, lukewarm support, and insistence does not build confidence or trust. One last suggestion, the next time you plan to bring in an outside firm to help with zoning, actually provide them with all the existing neighborhood plans as part of the scope of their work, this could have helped better shape the outcome, create less concern, and build trust with the community that hired you.",7

I've talked to them personally and they state that the can't stay in facilities without being told what they can and can't do. Therefore, we need to come to a resolution between them and you all.

If Austin partnered with ride share companies in an effort to promote ride share it would result in: fewer cars on the road, fewer emissions from cars, fewer pollutants such as trash/oil/debris on roads, more jobs created, lower DWI/DUI arrests, lower traffic accident mortality rate as well as frequency of accidents, lower congestion, increase tourism numbers, improve parking downtown and at other city centers. 
The most beneficially result of increased ride share activity would be lowering the amount of time the average citizen spends in traffic which will increase the economic utility of every citizen. More efficient travel will help lower the costs to local transportation companies resulting in higher margin or lower prices.",4

We live in a transition neighborhood and are invested in our neighbors and their ability to afford their homes. Austin is unaffordable for many. We are lucky to be able to own our home, but we are only a paycheck away from being unable to afford to live in Austin. This is the reality of many. I believe if we had more access to affordable housing, combined with denser, greener growth Austin would become more affordable for many. The parks, trails, and people of Austin are what makes it great to live in this city. Austin is the only place I would live in Texas -- I particularly like the smell of the fresh air. We can do better for our city and that starts with limiting the amount of influence certain organizations have over city leadership. Also, traffic is terrible. It is because of the anti-growth mentality that we've waited decades to make meaningful investments in our roads an infrastructure. That is not enough.

2453,2017,"Our cars and our neighbors cars have been hit by drunk drivers in the past several months.  In the past 3 months, 5 of our neighbors, as well as ourselves, were hit in the middle of the night between 12:30 - 3:00 a.m.
Each vehicle was totaled or pretty close to that. Our cars were parked in front of our homes on the street.  Due to the fact, they were a hit and run, we lost out and our insurance has to pay which brings our rates up.  That's not fair to us.
Not only were our cars hit, but my truck was hit by a drunk driver, resisting arrest and POM, and 2 other counts.  
The police officer wrote on a piece of paper the information of the driver who hit our truck.  The officer wrote the wrong address on the report.  I have been playing investigator because I feel the police are not helping me to get the information I need from the driver who hit my car. My car has been wrecked for 3 weeks now and it's still not fixed. 
I went downtown to buy the Police Report.  I paid for the Police Report. The report doesn't tell me anything. I went to the closest police station to my house to speak with police about the situation. They say there's nothing they can do.  Well, come on!!!!!!  Yes there is.  Although, the plates of the truck are from Mexico, the driver is from Austin, Texas. The driver, (he's borrowed this vehicle that hit my car), I believe the police need to help me go after the driver and find out if his insurance will fix my car and not only that, I have lost wages from not being able to go to work and from driving every where to get information.  I spent a week calling the police and 311. No one called me back as they said they would. I called again. I finally was transferred. Spoke to someone and was told someone would call me.  Again, no call.
My vehicle is still not fixed.  This also happened to my daughter. A vehicle hit her car while driving on an frontage road. The police showed up. 
Turns out the girl who hit my daughter was clearly at fault but didn't have insurance. Then police said that she found it and claimed she had insurance.  
My daughter submits the information to our insurance.  Turns out the girl who hit my daughter didn't have insurance. The insurance she had was not hers nor was the vin # registered to anyone in Texas but another state.   So, I feel the police are NOT THOROUGHLY CHECKING Nor are they helping to resolve situations that are occurring.
I want my truck fixed already. What is the City of Austin going to do about that.
Another situation is:  the fence between our home and the several neighbors that share our fence.  The fence is broke in so many places due to the several neighbors having a lot of dogs pushing our fence and creating holes where they'd jump through and end up in our yard.  We got so tired of complaining because no one did anything to help us. We stopped going into our back yard. Now it looks awful. The neighbors also shot fireworks and busted our kitchen window. They ran into their house and turned off their lights. We called the police. They said there was nothing they could do.  Our window is still broke almost a year later.  I don't have money to keep fixing my vehicles, my fence, my windows.  This is ridiculous!!!!!
The police or City of Austin do nothing to help us.  Yet, they take our money for whatever they can.",4

We lived in Round Rock for a few years because it was more affordable but then down-sized to move into the city because we hated spending so much time on the highway commuting.  While we enjoy living in Austin and the extra time our shorter commutes give our family, each year it seems to become less and less affordable for moderate income families like ours.

Code Next is going to alter family neighborhoods.      Creating a more dense population in areas where families live and raise their children is not a way to make this a city which welcomes people.     The school district is losing students because of the actions of the city.      And losing students means losing families and that means you will soon be a very ""hip"" city.      And  when there are fewer and fewer families, and the big money making companies move on to another city which will offer them the next big tax and fees break because those gifts have run out here, eventually who will be here?
When I moved here, there were green spaces and areas that welcomed people to enjoy a program of live music or fun things for families.    Now, it appears the city is much more interested in making SXSW bigger with  more hotel dollars and more publicity.   Lets make ACL festival draw more out of towners.         So what if nearly half a year is used up setting up, having or repairing damages from some big event. 
Please start thinking about the people who live here now, and have lived here.

Telling a mother ""if we checked up on every person who might be selling drugs in the park we wouldn't have room in our jail"" is not a best practice for community relations.

Raising a child on one income is hard enough and trying to save for a place to buy so my child will grow-up in the same community looks like a distant dream.  Soon, I will have to say goodbye to the city I grew up in, educated in (K-College), and fell in love with.",2

After such work, all over the city, so many streets are nearly like streets you'd expect to drive in a third world country. Try cruising around Powell Circle in south Austin to experience a prime example. The Streets Department is completely negligent in their enforcing their demands that contractors must return streets to their original condition after performing work. It's a disgrace. I have to get in a second comment: get rid of this ridiculous short term rental nonsense. Time after time after time after time - for years - we've had to call 3-1-1 in the middle of the night to complain about noise from a neighbor who rents out his duplex and nothing ever changes.

I have no desire to commute to a beautiful downtown edifice and drink a $5 Starbucks coffee when I can't get the book I want to read. That money would have been much better spent on getting more reading materials and making them electronically available so I can lie in my hammock drinking a 5 cent lemonade and reading what I want to read because it is easily electronically available.
