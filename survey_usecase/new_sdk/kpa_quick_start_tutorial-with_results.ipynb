    "# Using *Key Point Summarization* service for analyzing and finding insights in a survey data \n",
    "When you have a large collection of texts representing peopleâ€™s opinions (such as product reviews, survey answers or social media), it is difficult to understand the key issues that come up in the data. Going over thousands of comments is prohibitively expensive.  Existing automated approaches are often limited to identifying recurring phrases or concepts and the overall sentiment toward them, but do not provide detailed or actionable insights. \n",

    "In this tutorial you will gain hands-on experience in using *Key Point Summarization* (KPS) for analyzing and deriving insights from open-ended comments.  \n",

    "The data we will use is [a community survey conducted in the city of Austin](https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Community-Survey/s2py-ceb7). In this survey, the citizens of Austin were asked \"If there was ONE thing you could share with the Mayor regarding the City of Austin (any comment, suggestion, etc.), what would it be?\". "

When uploading comments into a domain, the *Key Point Summarization* service splits the comments into sentences and runs a minor cleansing on them. If you have domain-specific knowladge and want to split the comments into sentences or clean them yourself, you can use the *split_comments* or *clean_comments* domain_params when creating the domain to disable this functionality in KPS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that:\n",
    "* Comments_ids must be unique strings comprised of alphanumeric characters, spaces or underscores.\n",
    "* The number of comments_ids must match the number comments_texts\n",
    "* Comments_texts must not be longer than 3000 characters\n",
    "* Uploading the same comment several times (same domain + comment_id + comment_text) is not a problem and the comment is only processed once.\n",
    "* Uploading the same comment_id with a different comment_text will raise an exception. \n",
    "\n",
    "After being uploaded to the domain, the comments are processed. The method runs in a synchronous manner and returns only after all the comments are processed. In the meanwhile, the status of the processing is printed on screen.\n",
    "For information about running KPS in an async manner, see section 7."

    "Each domain has a cache that stores all intermediate results that are calculated during the summarization. Therefore modifing the run_params and running another summarization is usually faster since all intersecting intermediate results are retreived from cache. \n",

    "* By default, key points are extracted automatically. When we want to provide key points and match all sentences to these key points we can do so by passing them to the keypoints parameter: **run_param['key_points'] = [...]**. This enables a mode of work named human-in-the-loop where we first automatically extract key points, then we manually edit them (refine non-perfect key points, remove duplicated and add missing ones) and then run again, this time providing the edited keypoints as a given set of key points.\n",
    "* It is also possible to provide key points and let KPS add additional missing key points. To do so pass the key points to the key_point_candidates parameter: **run_param['key_point_candidates'] = [...]** (see section 6 for an elaborated example).\n",
    "* Change the lengths of the required key points and the sentences participating in the summarization.\n",
    "* The **mapping_policy** is used when mapping all sentences to the final key points: the default value is **NORMAL**. Changing to **STRICT** will cause only the sentence and key point pairs with very high matching confidence to be considered matched, increasing precision but potentially decreasing coverage. Changing it to **LOOSE** will do the opposite and match pairs with lower confidene. \n",

    "### 4.5 Add stance analysis to the summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In many usecases (surveys, customer feedback, etc.) the comments have positive and/or negative stance, and it is usful to create a KPS on each stance seperatly. Most stance detection models don't perform too well on survey data (also costumer feedbacks etc.) since the comments tend to have many \"suggestions\" in them, and the suggestions tend to appear as positive to the model while the user suggests to improve something that needs improvement. For that end we trained a stance-model that handles suggestions well and labels each sentence as 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral' and 'Suggestion'. We treat Suggestions as negatives and run two separate summarizations, first over 'Positive' sentences (pro) and second over 'Negative' and 'Suggestions' sentences (con).\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creates a separate positive/negative summary that shows clearly what works well and what needs to be improved.\n",
    "* Filters-out neutral sentences that usually don't contain valuable information.\n",
    "* Helps the matching model avoid stance mistakes (matching a positive sentence to a negative key point and vice-versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run for each stance seperately, use the **stance** parameter in *run_kps_job*. the options are either \"pro\", \"con\", or \"no-stance\" (default).\n",
    "First, let's run on *pro* sentences:"

    "We can now run a new summarization over all the data in the domain, as we did before, and automatically extract new key points. We can assume that some will be identical to the key points extracted on the 2016 data, some will be similar and some key points will be new.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better option is to run a new summarization but provide the keypoints from the 2016 summarization and let *Key Point Summarization* add new key points from the 2017 data if there are such. One benefit of this approach is that the new result will mostly use 2016 key point and we will be able to compare between them and view the trends. Another major benefit for this approach is run-time. 2016 data was already analyzed with these key points and since we have a cache in place, much of the computation can be avoided. The 2016 key points can be provided via the: **run_param['key_point_candidates'] = [...]** parameter, passing a list of strings, or we can use: **run_param['key_point_candidates_by_job_ids'] = [\\<job_id1\\>,...]** and provide a list of previous job_ids. KPS will take the key points from the jobs' result automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we'll run over the result without the stance analysis. We can also use the incremental approach when running on both stances: we will need to provide the job_id of the positive summarization of 2016 in the run_params_pro and the job_id of negative summarization of 2016 in the run_params_con when running on all sentences from 2016+2017.\n",
