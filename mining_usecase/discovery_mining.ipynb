However, it is very simple to adapt it to import data from  other source such as other search engines or collection of articles that reside in text files.\n",

    "The output includes three main parts:\n",
    "1. A table of the most argumentative statements with respect to the topic\n",
    "2. A narrative which automatically generated from the most argumentative statements\n",
