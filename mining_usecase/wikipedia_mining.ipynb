      "The crowd raised four issues. The first claim is that the Roman Empire played a vital role. In addition, we will hear about politics, regions and effectiveness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding role.  The Romans soon spread east, taking Greece, and the Greek heritage played an important role in the Roman Empire.   For example, the Roman Empire played a vital role in building up barbarian groups along its frontier.   The idea of a Christian empire continued to play a powerful role in Western Europe even after the collapse of Roman rule there; the name of the Holy Roman Empire bears witness to its claims to sanctity as well as to universal rule.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to politics.  The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time, and it was one of the largest empires in world history.   In the first century BC, it emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became the leading cultural, political and religious centre of Western civilisation.   While Rocker affirmed the former, Spengler considered the Roman Empire's imperial power a model for modern society.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The next issue is regions.  Spain flourished under the Roman empire Hispania, thus becoming one of the Empire's most important regions at the time.   The expansion of trade was made possible by the stability brought to the region by the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus (r.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, effectiveness.  Born out of the partition of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire created an effective military.   The Roman Empire's well-built aqueducts and cities and sturdy, effective naval fleets, ships and an organized system of paved roads also facilitated fast, easy travel and better networking and trade with neighboring nations and the provinces.   The ancient Roman Empire is a historical source, and the cosmopolitan royalty and also nobility were effective in spreading etiquette throughout Europe.  \n",
