2382,I honestly don't understand how this process went through any kind of thorough community engagement and this is the result we have.,7,2016
2383,"I think the solutions lie in recruiting a diverse city staff (especially in NHCD), hiring diverse consultants that are able to reach the people most impacted by the city's plans (even if that means holding public engagement events in cities like Manor, Elgin and Del Valle, which have been the recipients of our lower-income people of color), and again, putting our money where our mouth is.",7,2016

2392,I used to live in Austin in the 90's and moved back 2 years ago.,10,2016
2393,I can't believe how the rat population has exploded exponentially and nothing other than hiring costly private companies as a quick fix to one residence is the only thing the city of Austin seems to be doing.,10,2016
2394,"When we moved here to a newly, fully renovated home in a nice neighborhood, we shortly discovered the house was infested with rats in the walls and attic.",10,2016
2395,Apparently it was a problem that could never get fully resolved bc of the tenacity of the rats to get back in to the home.,10,2016
2396,I soon learned how many friends and acquaintances (and in their personal experience) that the rat problem in people's homes is all too common and all too costly to eradicate.,10,2016
2397,The City of Austin REALLY needs to implement the same type of chemical sterilization program that New York City and Chicago have implemented to control their rat problems.,10,2016

2439,The construction of our metro system is fundamentally flawed.,3,2016
2440,"It serves a population that is affluent, i.e., flush with motor vehicles who don't need to use public transit, except for when they want to come downtown and drink, but not face charges of a DUI/DWI.",3,2016
2441,Public transit is a must in the modern Austin.,3,2016
2442,The failure of this city to provide a metro line to south Austin is mind-boggling.,3,2016

2453,"After dealing with 10 years of traffic issues I have given up on the City Management on choosing measures that will help reduce the amount of traffic on I-35, Mopac, or any of the major streets.",5,2016
2454,"Even more, the need to propose and award projects to the businesses who donate the most money to the City Hall members and their election efforts is leading to more and more distrust within the community.",5,2016
2455,"Also, the City's need to over-regulate has chased away two of the largest traffic congestion options - Uber and Lyft, shows that there is more of an interest in the City earning dollars on businesses in town instead of helping to resolve the problems.",5,2016
2456,"Multiple TNCs have opened in town, but it has been 4 months since Uber & Lyft left town and the driving availability and cost of using the current TNCs is led more people to drive on their own, congest more traffic, take up more parking spots, or simply stay home where the city loses out on a LOT of tax dollars.",5,2016
