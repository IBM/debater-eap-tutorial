    "# Using *Key Point Summarization* service for analyzing and finding insights in a survey data \n",
    "When you have a large collection of texts representing people’s opinions (such as product reviews, survey answers or social media), it is difficult to understand the key issues that come up in the data. Going over thousands of comments is prohibitively expensive.  Existing automated approaches are often limited to identifying recurring phrases or concepts and the overall sentiment toward them, but do not provide detailed or actionable insights. \n",

In this survey, the citizens of Austin were asked \"If there was ONE thing you could share with the Mayor regarding the City of Austin (any comment, suggestion, etc.), what would it be?\". "

    "* By default, key points are extracted automatically. When we want to provide key points and match all sentences to these key points we can do so by passing them to the keypoints parameter: **run_param['key_points'] = [...]**. This enables a mode of work named human-in-the-loop where we first automatically extract key points, then we manually edit them (refine non-perfect key points, remove duplicated and add missing ones) and then run again, this time providing the edited keypoints as a given set of key points.\n",
    "* It is also possible to provide key points and let KPS add additional missing key points. To do so pass the key points to the key_point_candidates parameter: **run_param['key_point_candidates'] = [...]** (see section 6 for an elaborated example).\n",
    "* Change the lengths of the required key points and the sentences participating in the summarization.\n",
    "* The **mapping_policy** is used when mapping all sentences to the final key points: the default value is **NORMAL**. Changing to **STRICT** will cause only the sentence and key point pairs with very high matching confidence to be considered matched, increasing precision but potentially decreasing coverage. Changing it to **LOOSE** will do the opposite and match pairs with lower confidene. \n",

    "### 4.5 Add stance analysis to the summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In many usecases (surveys, customer feedback, etc.) the comments have positive and/or negative stance, and it is usful to create a KPS on each stance seperatly. Most stance detection models don't perform too well on survey data (also costumer feedbacks etc.) since the comments tend to have many \"suggestions\" in them, and the suggestions tend to appear as positive to the model while the user suggests to improve something that needs improvement. For that end we trained a stance-model that handles suggestions well and labels each sentence as 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral' and 'Suggestion'. We treat Suggestions as negatives and run two separate summarizations, first over 'Positive' sentences (pro) and second over 'Negative' and 'Suggestions' sentences (con).\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creates a separate positive/negative summary that shows clearly what works well and what needs to be improved.\n",
    "* Filters-out neutral sentences that usually don't contain valuable information.\n",
    "* Helps the matching model avoid stance mistakes (matching a positive sentence to a negative key point and vice-versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run for each stance seperately, use the **stance** parameter in *run_kps_job*. the options are either \"pro\", \"con\", or \"no-stance\" (default).\n",
    "First, let's run on *pro* sentences:"
