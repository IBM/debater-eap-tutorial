    "When you have a large collection of texts representing people’s opinions (such as product reviews, survey answers or  social media), it is difficult to understand the key issues that come up in the data. Going over thousands of comments is prohibitably expensive.  Existing automated approaches are often limited to identifying recurring phrases or concepts and the overall sentiment toward them, but do provide detailed or actionable insights.\n",

In this survey, the citizens of Austin where asked \"If there was ONE thing you could share with the Mayor regarding the City of Austin (any comment, suggestion, etc.), what would it be?\". \n",

    "In this tutorial, we showed how *Key Point Analysis* can provide you with detailed insights over survey data right out of the box - significantly reducing the effort required by a data scientist to analyze the data.  We also demonstrated how key point analysis over unstructured text can be combined with available structured information, to provide new views over the data.   Finally, we showed how utilizing of additional Project Debater text analysis services such as *Argument Quality*, *Term Wikifier* , and *Term Relater* can further improve the quality of the results."
