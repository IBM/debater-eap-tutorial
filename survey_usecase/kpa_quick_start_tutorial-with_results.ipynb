Going over thousands of comments is prohibitively expensive.  Existing automated approaches are often limited to identifying recurring phrases or concepts and the overall sentiment toward them, but do not provide detailed or actionable insights.\n",

Another major benefit for this approach is run-time. 2016 data was already analyzed with these key points and since we have a cache in place much of the computation can be avoided. The 2016 key points can be provided via the: **run_param['keypoint_candidates'] = [...]** parameter, passing a list of strings, or we can use: **run_param['keypoint_candidates_by_job_id'] = <job_id>** and provide the job_id of an analysis job.

    "## 4. Run *Key Point Analysis* on each stance separately\n",
    "In many use-cases (surveys, customer feedback, etc') the comments have positive and/or negative stance, and it is usful to create a KPA analysis on each stance seperatly. Most stance detection models don't perfome too well on survey data (also costumer feedbacks etc') since the comments tend to have many \"suggestions\" in them, and the suggestions tend to apear positive to the model while the user suggests to improve something that needs improvement.\n",
    "For that end we trained a stance-model that handles suggestions well and labels each sentence as 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral' and 'Suggestion'. We usually treat Suggestions as negatives and run two separate analysis, first over 'Positive' sentences and second over 'Negative' and 'Suggestions' sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the following advantages:\n",
    "* Creates a separate positive/negative summary that shows clearly what works well and what needs to be improved.\n",
    "* Filters-out neutral sentences that usually don't contain valuable information.\n",
    "* Helps the matching model avoid stance mistakes (matching a positive sentence to a negative key point and vice-versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets run again, over the Austin survey dataset, but this time create two seperate KPA analyses (positive and negative). We will first need to create a new domain and add the domain_param **do_stance_analysis**."

We also demonstrated key *key point analysis* features such as how to modify the analysis parameters and increase coverage, how to use the stance-model and create per-stance results, how to create *key points graph* and further improve the quality and the clarity of the results, and how to incrementally add new data.\n",
