# Project Debater Early Access Program  

Project Debater was the first AI to successfully engage with a human in a live debate. In February 2019, Project Debater debated Mr. Harish Natarajan, one of the world's leading professional debaters in an event held in San Francisco and broadcasted live worldwide. In 2020, the underlying technologies that enabled the live event were available as software services, denoted as Project Debater Early Access Program.  These included  core natural language understanding capabilities, argument mining, text summarization and narrative generation. 

In 2024, the Debater Early Access Program was sunset after several years of availability to the academic community and API access was discontinued.

The Project Debater datasets are still available:
