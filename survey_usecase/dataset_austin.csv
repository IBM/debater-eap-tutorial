Also, extremely dissatisfied with all the free handouts to people who are perfectly capable of earning their own money.  I'm very dissatisfied with the liberal leaning local politicians."
2,2016,"Maintenance of city facilities needs to be equitable across the city. We need to think long-term; Austin can't sustain it's current level of ""chic"" indefinitely. What are we going to do when the cool beautiful people move to a community with more shiny dime-store objects to lure them? Long after the current boom goes bust (and it always does) the rest of us real Austinites will still be here. It really is time to stop sacrificing the quality of life on the east side of town (or any of the  less-privileged parts of town) for the wants of those living in the wealthier areas. The differences from one neighborhood to the next are quite visible. Public transportation needs to be a primary issue, whether the numerous single-car drivers like it or not. In short, we need to find our way back to being both more humane and pragmatic."

65,2016,"As City of Austin is growing toward the East side of the town, I would like to request the Mayor to build more Parks & Play grounds in the East side of the City.

70,2016,"Austin Energy is ""tricky."" They make it hard to question a bill. ""Averaging"" instead of reading meter is dishonest & causes problems for customers."
71,2016,"AUSTIN ENERGY IS CRAZY EXPENSIVE DURING JUNE, JULY, I WAS TOLD WHY BUT THIS HEAT IS TOO HOT TO NOT RUN ELECTRICITY/AC 24/7"
72,2016,"Austin energy needs to be overhauled or reviewed.  The customer service is beyond terrible, they have no explanation for why things occur, the people are rude and its a monopoly.  The increases in rates and their overall plan is ridiculous, and even though I'm a rate payer, I have no ability to change it.  Competition is needed immediately."

76,2016,"Austin has become too expensive and wages have been stagnant for too long.  The only people who are able to enjoy the City are people who move here from other places that are much more affluent, but anyone who is from here is barely able to get by.  Many people are working two or more jobs to make ends meet, making it difficult to find time to take advantage of parks or pools, or any other type of recreational activity.  I think Austin provides a lot of great services but until affordability is addressed, it's hard for people to utilize them."

78,2016,BETTER CITY BUS SYSTEM MORE OFTEN.
79,2016,Better infrastructure of roads.
80,2016,"Austin has not made adequate preparations for the millions of new residents to this city.  Instead, tourism is of high priority with increased funding and incentives for new hotels and out-of-state business venture capitalists.  Living on the fringe of downtown is no longer affordable and it is only a matter of time before I have to leave completely.  I am very disappointed that Austin has become the new Dallas."
81,2016,Austin Independent School District is terrible.  Benchmark testing does not work.  Kids only study for the test.  Don't like toll roads on top of taxes.  Austin is a good place to own a business.
82,2016,"Austin is a great city overall, except traffic being a big problem."
83,2016,"Austin is a unique city with exceptional green space in spite of its growth. Your/our challenge is to maintain that ""country"" feel while tackling one our biggest problems which is transportation/traffic. Best of luck to us all in succeeding!"
84,2016,Austin is a wonderful place to live except of course the traffic. I would like to see ride sharing come back to Austin (almost $50 taxi ride round trip to downtown from 6 mile out is a bit much). Unfortunately with all the people moving to town the traffic is not going to get better. I know that mass transit is doing all that they can to reduce the amount of cars on the road. Maybe reducing the price on the toll roads would help.
85,2016,"AUSTIN IS AMAZING, PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD JOB, SAFETY & WEIRDNESS IS A GOOD THING."
86,2016,Austin is not affordable. Traffic is horrible and makes it hard to enjoy the city. Austin nites stay home to avoid tourists. Our city is held hostage by visitors and newcomers.

95,2016,AUSTIN POLICE FAILS TO HELP UNLESS IT IS A MAJOR CRIME.
96,2016,AUSTIN POSTAL SERVICES NEEDS TO BE AUDIT AND OFFER BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE TO OUR LOCAL RESIDENTS.
97,2016,"Austin should be pro-growth.  Fix the major corridors (183/360/Mopac) and fix the development review/permitting/inspection department; simplify it and eliminate city staff; outsource to third party inspectors, architects, etc."
98,2016,"Austin should use dedicated bus lanes and bicycle lanes like Atlanta, Georgia and solve traffic issues."

100,2016,Austin Traffic &  Too many cars on roads. Rebuild IH-35!...Major highway IH-35 needs a big over-haul!!
101,2016,Austin traffic (especially the morning commute) needs help!
102,2016,Austin Utility Services need an overhaul-especially water/wastewater.  The billing for water/wastewater usage is confusing and way too expensive.  Both electric and water bills at times are so high that it is over half of what I pay on my home mortgage.  That just isn't right.  People living in Austin deserve better than this.  Water bills are way out of control....
103,2016,BAD TRAFFIC. MULTI HOME DWELLINGS TOO MANY!
104,2016,Based on the questions in the survey it appears that Austin provides a lot of programs to residents.  I am sorry I did not/do not know more about them to take advantage of all the benefits Austin has to offer besides the city and people
105,2016,Be factual & objective when reviewing and approving road & development projects. It is embarrassing the politics that have been played in approval of the Grove Project. The Grove will enhance our neighborhood & will be a significant enhancement to the quality of life in central Austin.

112,2016,"Beautiful City, plenty of things to do."
113,2016,"Before focusing on bringing more people to this city, upgrade the roads to what it should be 20 years after its complete. This way Austin could host all these events that we are passed over, because of our lacking roads and parking. Hotels are gaining more rooms. Now we should be know for music and great people. Not for traffic and the hassle to get around in Austin."

132,2016,Better traffic flow and traffic light timing.
133,2016,Better traffic flow. Traffic is horrible in Austin!
134,2016,"Better training for the 3-1-1 operators.  My experience with them is they will say almost anything to make the caller happy.  I called four times concerning an error by the waste disposal folks, and each time I was promised action within 24 hours.  On the 4th call, the 3-1-1- operator gave me the cell phone number for the waste management departmental manager and told me to talk to them directly.  Too much bureaucratic CYA and too little real service.  Very disappointing considering the monthly fees the City of Austin collects."
135,2016,Better training of utility employees!!!
136,2016,"BETTER TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS, GET UBER/LUFT BACK"

170,2016,Can you please get someone to fix potholes (on) South 1st?
171,2016,"Capital Metro is missing out on the opportunity to fully electrify the fleet of buses.  Also the service range, coverage and frequency is completely inadequate.
Many people would use the service if the frequency, cleanliness, WiFi and safety were insured for Public Transportation network.  Multiple bus sizes should be deployed, 
fully electric, and set a national standard for sustainability.  A declaration of ""Net Zero"" by 2050 is meaningless if Public Transport continues to languish with dinosaur, loud, polluting diesel buses which continue to be deployed.  12 cities in the USA have decided to go 100% electric-- yet somehow Austin escapes this opportunity-- but loves to self congratulate on how ""green"" and sustainable we are.  Big disconnect."
172,2016,CENTRAL FOCUL POINT FOR TRACKING ALL HELO DO NEEDED
173,2016,"Chalmers courts is a Horrible place. Police does very random checks and once they leave cars come and go there has been people that live there who walk their dogs and let them do their necessity's without them cleaning right by my house. I've called 311 they suggested I call the apartment office, when I called them the lady who answered said I cant do anything about it and hung up.

216,2016,Concentrate on automobile traffic. Bicycles are not a solution to reducing congestion and improving travel in this city. Bicycle lanes have negatively impacted travel and safety in this city.
217,2016,"Concentrate on maintaining our safety (Police, Fire, and EMS) , establishing a solid & scalable infrastructure (roads, bridges, rail, etc.), and less regulation for the sake of regulation - ex: Uber/Lyft have more safety for driver & rider built-into their business-model & app's than anything the City of Austin can do yet city wants a 'piece of the pie' - the city should be working with companies and community to eliminate barriers rather than creating more barriers."

227,2016,"Continue to support and promote thoughtful development in our neighborhood! (North East Austin), and focus on Austin public schools. Thanks!"
228,2016,Continue to try to acquire more funds for the city for our mobility issues.  The city tends to try to fix highway issues after the city has expanded/businesses built.  Look into providing more highways or upgrading roads before the traffic issue becomes a problem.

Your employees do not need pay increases every year and many at the top level get paid too much.   There are already too many bike paths in this city and not enough paved surfaces for vehicles.   Prop 1 is a disaster and does not address the real needs for the city.   Some hard decisions need to be made. Simply deflecting the rate of tax increase is not going far enough.   
Lastly, better utilize our beautiful lakes in the Austin metro area by actively promoting fishing.   I'm sure the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department would help you develop and promote those opportunities at no cost to the city.

359,2016,"First think I noticed when I moved from Portland, OR to Austin, it's how similar they are, for good and bad. Like Portland, the City of Austin does not seem to plan well for growth, and projects are often delayed and over budget. I expected better, being that there is a big difference in mentality between Oregon's government and Texas. I grew up in McAllen, TX, and I was always impressed on how McAllen, like other Texas cities, are always ahead of growth when it comes to road infrastructure. Austin, on the other had, shows such lack of planning and execution. The city is growing fast, while the road infrastructure is falling behind. Roads are poorly maintain. On top of that, density of neighborhoods are [purposely] increasing, putting pressure to existing road infrastructure. If this city were like McAllen, Slaughter Lane would already be finished all the way to Hwy. 183, with at least 4 lanes. Austin has likely wasted more money on studies and planning that what it would had cost to build it back in 2005. City leaders need to do a much better job keep up with growth. By the way, light rail made no difference in Portland to alleviate congestion -- and they spent billions on it and more in subsidies, every year."
360,2016,"First, I think Mayor Adler is a complete blessing to the city of Austin and I very much appreciate everything he has tried to do for us in this gorgeous city. That being said, and I do not attribute this to his mayoral time in office, our city road and highway system is in need of a major overhaul. The Mopac ""improvement"" project is really just a joke -- a variable rate toll lane is not going to solve our north/south traffic flow issues. As someone who lives right off of Mopac and Far West, I am fortunate to be able to get around most jams during the day, but when it comes to rush hour morning or evening, there is just no getting around Austin. I find it so disheartening that in this beautiful city, people that live north and south cannot meet up for a quick workout in the evenings or meet for dinner to catch up due to the extreme traffic problem. I know Mayor Adler doesn't have full control over state highway projects in Austin, but I would like for him to know I appreciate his efforts in expanding our city roads (whether that be through new traffic patterns, new lanes, bike/bus lanes, etc)."

Speed limits in neighborhoods are too fast. 30 mph kills children and pedestrians.
The fact that there is still no light rail in this city is just a sad, sad reality.
We took the bus to see the fireworks on 4th of July. When we exited Zilker park with hordes of people at the end of the display - we found all of the bus stops closed! There was no way to get home. Bands of roving people searched for an open bus station -someone texted the bus stop and told the crowd 'It says they closed the bus routes down here because of the traffic!"" All the people howled and jeered. We couldn't believe it. Bus stops closed when we need them most. Who is in charge of this ship? We're going off course. The new Prop 1 seems like it will hardly do anything except expand roads. Depressing. We're all getting trapped in our neighborhoods. Austin has so many things to offer, but you can't get to them without driving. So people stay home."
472,2016,Glad Marc Ott is leaving - incompetent.
473,2016,Good job regulating Uber!
474,2016,"Gotta do something about taxes...they are out of control. I know we're a growing city and have lots of development needs so I support the road bonds, except for more bike lanes....what a waste. The level of needless regulation and meddling on things like Uber/Lyft and Home away/Airbnb boggles the mind. The conservation efforts are overblown. Lakes are full, the water department needs the revenue to cover growth. Electric Utility piggy bank has got to stop. Finally, you have to streamline the development process and the upgrade building code department."
475,2016,Government workers should not drive to work.  Provide public transportation to prevent traffic overflow.
476,2016,Great city. Hoping for a rock-star new City Manager!
477,2016,GREAT PLACE. TRAFFIC ISSUES.
478,2016,GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND MORE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN MAKING POLICY DECISIONS
479,2016,"Growth and progress is good, but please don't let Austin grow too fast or in ways that make it just like any other city (i.e. Houston!). Small businesses, small homes, middle and low income families are being priced out and even in the few years I've been here, I sometimes don't recognize Austin."
480,2016,GROWTH AND TRAFFIC. NEIGHBORHOOD INTEGRITY.
481,2016,GROWTH IS KILLING THE CITY I USED TO LOVE
482,2016,Growth is wonderful until it becomes detrimental to those within the area.  Austin must stop growing.  We cannot provide equal everything in a city that is beyond its capacity. Money is not the answer nor is technology; quality of human life is what defines a city.
483,2016,Growth needs to pay for itself.
484,2016,HAVE ALL PARTS OF TOWN BE IN THE YARD WASTE RECYCLING PROGRAM.
485,2016,HAVE MAIN ROADS CLEANED UP AND FIC 360 TRAFFIC
486,2016,Have permits for new commercial build outs be processed faster.

491,2016,"help city of Austin workers find happiness :) they always seem so unhappy when I call for bill questions, service, etc."
492,2016,"Help our public schools, please."
493,2016,HELP THE TRAFFIC FLOW ON BROODIE AND MANCHACA.
494,2016,HIGH HIGHLY EXCESSIBLE UTILITY RATES
495,2016,High speed local transit & trolleys

498,2016,Hire more police.

500,2016,I believe he is doing a fine job. Attention is being given to the problems of a rapidly growing urban city and I hope he remains mayor as long as is legally possible!
501,2016,"Holy cow, City of Austin Utilities (water, sewer, garbage) is *awful*!  Super high bills, no transparency in the metering of water, charge me for every scrap of garbage that doesn't fit in the can, terrible customer service, bad web site, etc.  I am routinely astonished at how high my monthly bill is, and how little I get for it.  My neighbors in a nearby development are in a MUD, and get much better service for way less money."

510,2016,I ABSOLUTE`LY HATE BEING FORCED TO PAY MULTIPLE CUSTOMER FEES ON MY CITY OF AUSTIN UTILITY BILLS
511,2016,"I am all for adding businesses to the Austin area, but we need a better public transit system and easier access to the city with bikes."
512,2016,I am always so sad to see the residents at RBJ living as the forgotten and thrown away. There are so many people who need a cheap place to live and there aren't enough places for low income and fired income people.
513,2016,I AM AN OKLAHOMA BUT HAD GOOD LIFE IN AUSTIN 91 YRS OLD
514,2016,I wish Austin would make the Climate Protection Plan more conspicuous.
515,2016,"I am frustrated that there is still no new high school in southwest Austin despite the overwhelming need for one. AISD enrollment is down in some areas but not in southwest Austin. Why no investment (which has already been paid and voted for by the way) in anything other than a Magnet School? Shame on you. A bait and switch tactic that has left me not wanting to approve ANY bond issue. I simply feel that the council cater to some in Austin, but definitely not all and definitely NOT those of us in southwest Austin."
516,2016,"I am furious and exhausted with the mopac improvement plan. My neighborhood has been subjected to 2+ years of noise, dirt, filthy side walks, overgrown common areas, rude drivers, etc. I am an active athletic 60 year old female that can not even get to the park with my dog for fear of being run over, stepping on glass, caught in wires and other construction material, and eyed by construction workers. I feel afraid in my own home due to so many workers around watching my comings and goings. Additionally, I can't get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time and spend hours wasted away in traffic. This was a poorly planned project and to subject Mopac homeowners to this for 2+ years is appalling, especially given the taxes I pay for my little tiny house. I am a single mom,  RN of 40 years that raised two children in Austin. Thank goodness they are grown and do not live here to see the mess.  I have recently obtained my master's in nursing and am now a Nurse Practitioner. I will be moving to Haiti to work as a missionary and plan to keep my house for a while longer but if Austin does not improve the traffic situation and clean up around Mopac, I will leave and move to be with my children. I have been living in Austin off/on my entire life as my mother and father met here and my grandparents retired here; I am sad to see what Austin has become."
517,2016,"I am glad affordable housing is on the Mayor's radar. But the old neighborhoods of East Austin are rapidly being demolished and replaced with monolithic boxes that don't reflect the character of the neighborhood. We are working with the Historic Landmark Office. But, the process is too slow to remedy the current situation. We need some emergency help!"
518,2016,I AM REAL SICK OF NOT HAVING A CHOICE OF ELECTRIC COMPANY. DO NOT WANT CITY PROVIDE UTILTIES
519,2016,I AM SAD THAT THE GREAT MUSIC VENUES ARE BEING RUN OUT OF DOWNTOWN.
520,2016,I AM SAD TO SEE THE CHARACTER AND QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGE SO DRASTICALLY AS WE GROW AND NOT ALWAYS FOR THE BETTER
521,2016,"I am sure employees themselves are not different that most people, however, I was OVER-BILLED for several YEARS by a COA accident - hundreds of dollars and city policy was to only refund 1/3 to 1/2 of that. THAT was unethical. There's no statute of limitations if I owe the city MONEY!!"
522,2016,"I am very concerned with highway and pedestrian safety.  As the city grows and traffic becomes more congested the speed limits need to be reduced.  Pedestrian and traffic fatalities are a terrible tragedy and can be reduced by facing up to the reality of congestion and need to reduce speeds over 35 miles per hour on city streets.  Pedestrians are at great risk, particularly children, and unrealistic speed limits reflect an Austin that no longer exists.  Related is the need to educate everyone on the changing congestion situation and how we must all deal with it.  Bicycles only add to the need to adjust speed to actual and real conditions to save lives and reduce injuries."
523,2016,"I am very displeased with the way the City handled negotiations with Uber and Lyft.  Public transportation has always been problematic here.  Taxis are few, unresponsive, unreliable and expensive.  I live only 5 miles from downtown, yet I rarely participate in local events due to transportation issues (taxis, parking, etc.) and the many tourists that  overtake our City on most weekends.  Ride-sharing changed that.  It was safe, affordable and a great option for a resident who might want to catch a band and have drinks....no drinking  and driving.  I will not vote for the council member in my district and would encourage others to get out and vote to avoid re-election of the current council."
524,2016,I APPRECIATE THE WALNUT CREEK HIKE AND BIKE TRAIL THAT HS BEEN BUILT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS BEING USED BY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE EACH DAY
525,2016,I love my city!
526,2016,"I believe the ""GROVE"" development review is slanted to get it approved and is ignoring the facts of traffic patterns that have been stated by the city engineers. Shame on you. I want the GROVE to go forward, but you better plan it right before construction begins or it will be a mess!"
527,2016,"I can no longer afford to live in Austin due to the high property taxes--look for, find and eliminate tax dollar waste! Start with Austin Energy."
528,2016,"I can't afford to buy a home in the neighborhood I desire due to ridiculous pricing for a ""regular"" house. We aren't talking Westlake here. I'm tired of more people moving here every day because it's so ""cool"" to be in Austin. I feel confined to my condo (again can't afford a house) because the thought of venturing out into this traffic and crowd nightmare is so stressful and overwhelming. The only reason I'm still here is because I work at a state job and I have 15-years to go before I can retire. That day can't come fast enough. The schools are yucky unless you can afford to live in a neighborhood with $500k plus homes.  My parents in their 60s feel the same. I grew up here so I should know what has happened to this once lovely place. I'm a single mom who doesn't receive any public assistance of any kind (nor do I want to). I feel like I'm in a weird income class. Seems like everyone here is super rich or on assistance."
529,2016,"I completely depend on Public Transportation, but I am unable to get from point A to B due to a lack of bus and train schedule.  This past weekend I had a job opportunity on Saturday, but there was no transit to get me there in a timely fashion."
530,2016,I dislike and disagree with open carry.
531,2016,"I DISLIKE I-35 AND MOPAC, I TRY TO AVOID THEM BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC"
532,2016,I enjoy living in Austin and I hope the city continues being a safe city.
533,2016,I fear for minorities interacting with police and know as a lawyer that people without means don't get a fair shake in our court system.
534,2016,"I FEEL MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS IGNORED IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION ENHANCEMENT PLANNING, HARRIS RIDGE"
535,2016,"I growth is so great for us, why does our property tax keep increasing?"
536,2016,"I HAD EXTREMELY HIGH WATER BILL (ACCORDING TO THEM IT WAS ENOUGH WATER TO FILL A POOL)L.FIRST IT TOOK WEEKS TO TALK TO SOMEONE, WHEN I DID I WAS ASSUMED QUALITY & NO WRONG FROM THEM. I WAS THREATENED W/SERVICE CUT OFF"
537,2016,"I have a general dissatisfaction with the direction in which general transit projects have gone. There seems to be a tendency within the city to compromise on these projects where the end result doesn't solve the original problem and still costs the city a large sum of money. Cases in point: The light rail system was built on 1960s technology (to save money) and didn't extend to the airport (to save money) and doesn't have parking lots near many of the stops (to save money) and is therefore useless to 90% of the people living in Austin while costing everyone in the city money. Further, the mopac extension of ONE lane (a toll lane) will do almost nothing to alleviate traffic while causing years of traffic delays. Further, for many of the lower income people who moved further from our city's center due to housing costs the variable priced toll could negate an hour or two of work in an eight hour work day which could make the toll lane prohibitively expensive. 
-you know... I doubt the mayor or anyone in his office will read this but you asked."
538,2016,"I have an older home and I am afraid of code enforcement, I can't get any work done because it could trigger a cascade of other expensive and randomly assigned repairs depending on the mood of the compliance officers."
539,2016,I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE AUSTIN IS A PLACE WHERE YOUNG AND WELL.
540,2016,"I have lived here for over fifty years. I feel that the quality of life in Austin has declined significantly, especially in the past ten years. If my health permitted, I would not live here anymore.
The things that made Austin a special place though live have been eroded to the point of being almost non-existent at the present time , and I do not believe it possible to bring them back.
Alas the Austin, place I loved, no longer exists."
541,2016,I HAVE LIVED IN MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. I CHOSE TO RETIRE IN AUSTIN.
542,2016,I live in District 6 and Don Zimmerman does not adequately represent me.  I do not agree with him at all.
543,2016,"I live in fear of hitting a bicycle. But I don't think giving them more lanes and rights is the answer. Sadly, streets are and never will be safe for bicyclists. We have to either outlaw them completely or create true off-street bikeways, and make them ride on sidewalks. Providing more bike lanes and dashed lanes is adding to the problem because drivers have no idea what the rules are, and neither do bicycles. Suddenly, tons of strange dotted lines have appeared at intersections and few people know what the hell to do. I'd really like to see more public transit and no bikes on streets. I know I sound like an ultra-conservative, but I'm actually ultra-liberal. It's just that we have to drive cars in this society, and something drastic needs to happen about bikes."
544,2016,"I live in the Villages a new senior community on E Ben White Blvd. I am grateful for a nice place to live that I can afford. The Staff are wonderful and hard working and are trying to make the best environment  for seniors. Just to let you know-- when I moved in I made arrangements to have my utilities transferred on June 27. The electric was transferred with no problem. The Gas company did not transfer until 5 days later and I was charged 10 dollars per day by the complex for a total of 50 dollars. That is a lot of money on a fixed income. When I called the gas company  I was told that even though everyone is important that my gas was already turned on so the others were done first. Is this done to everyone? Not a good way to do business when there is no other choice. I love Austin and choose to live here but now that I am ageing it is getting more difficult to live here. Thanks for you time and attention.

545,2016,"I live on s.s retirement, do city of Austin give some discount on utility bills ?"
546,2016,I LOVE LIVING IN AUSTIN
547,2016,I wish it didn't cost so much to keep living in the city and working downtown!
548,2016,"I love this city, but as a single person, I feel like I'll be pushed out of the city soon due to home/rental prices. Even when I made $45,000 as a teacher (I make less now), I wouldn't ever be able to own a home or eventually keep up with rent prices."
549,2016,I really wish that city planning would find a way to improve traffic flow.
550,2016,"I recently had plumbing issues. I called 311 and within an hour a crew of workers showed up & assessed the problem, & returned the next day to install a clean out of the easement. I was extremely impressed with the response time & professionalism of the workers! The equipment they had to efficiently complete the job"
551,2016,I support those living near the Grove at Shoal Creek. Too bad this land could not be a park! I am against the Austin Parks Charrette & removing any trees. Am concerned about many old water pipes breaking & just being patched.
552,2016,"I suspect this is not isolated solely to Austin, however, it seems the growth has outpaced our available resources - water and roads. It may not be popular, but I believe we need some serious research into sustainable population levels for the area, and ways to dissuade overpopulation."
553,2016,I thank the City of Austin Police for their protection. Your job is hard...it always has been but we are going through tough times. Please know you are supported.
554,2016,"I think allowing Uber and Lyft to leave Austin is irresponsible.  It was a program that many people were using to access restaurants and bars which significantly increased safety on our roads and many people were finding it better for transportation than owning a car, which reduced traffic downtown, provided significant convenience to Austin visitors and made our downtown much more available to Austin residents."
555,2016,I think property taxes are too high for people living a long time in one neighborhood.
556,2016,"I think some of the grass along the side walks in my neighborhood and the grass along Mickeny Falls parkway should be better maintained. There are some sidewalks that are unusable. And the grass is so high it is difficult to see on oncoming traffic.
Thank you"
557,2016,"I THINK THE 3 MAIN PROBLEMS I SEE WITH AUSTIN ARE TRAFFIC, AFFORDABILITY AND MOSQUITOS, EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOOD"
558,2016,"I think the biggest issue in the city is the falling African American population.  A large part of this problem is the lack of affordable housing in the city and the gentrification of east Austin.  The city also must find a way to attract middle class African American families and young professionals to the city.  When I think of Austin compared to Houston, my hometown, the one thing that stands out as a negative is the overall lack of diversity in the city itself.  This isn't an easy issue to tackle, but I have confidence given the overall superb job done by the city, that we can find away to address it and make major improvements.  This question should be on the tip of all the city staff's tongues... How can we make Austin a desirable city for people of all ethnicities?"
559,2016,"I think transportation is going to be a driving force for mobility, business, and recreation for years to come."
560,2016,I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER WE ARE THE LEADER OF  HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX IN TEXAS AND THE USA AND ACT ACCORDINGLY.
561,2016,I think you're doing a great job! The traffic is to heavy and the property tax is to high but what are you going to do in a booming economy? Figure out this ride share thing and I'll be pretty happy.
562,2016,I want the cops to stop using deadly force on all races . All Lives Matter .
563,2016,"I want Uber/Lyft. I can't care about finger printing, I care about how I get home after I've been out drinking. Austin cabs are terrible. T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E"
564,2016,"I was being harassed at work and I called the police to make a report, waited to hear back from someone like I was told, I then got a letter 3-4 weeks later saying they were dropping the case because I never called them back but I was still waiting on them to call me. I then created a 2nd report, got the same letter 2 weeks later. It took my boss calling for me to even get a real person on the phone. I felt like I was unimportant to this detective and he had ""better things to deal with"" even though I was being terrorized. I am still upset by the way my case was handled, and that it took nearly a year to get resolved all because no one would acknowledge my police reports."
565,2016,"I was born here, grew up here, and currently live/work here.  That all will change when my property taxes go beyond what I can afford in the next few years.  Tax breaks are a joke when they knock off ~$20 and increase ten times that amount year to year.  I do not have kids, nor do I plan to have them- and yet the majority of my tax money is sent to public schools which I feel disconnected with as a non-parent.  In addition to being priced out by property tax increases, the cost of energy is absolutely atrocious.  Without competition for the Austin Energy monopoly, AE stifles market forces allowing for better prices.  I live with a roommate, who works for a grocery store (Central Market) near full time hours and can't afford a basic efficiency apartment on their paycheck.  How are people in the service industry expected to have a decent quality of life in this town if they can't afford it?  TLDR: Austin is becoming too expensive- don't know what you can do to help, but anything is appreciated."
566,2016,I wish rent was a bit more affordable.
567,2016,I wish the City of Austin would take action to regulate the large number of panhandlers at street intersections. It gives the city a poor image. Could these people be directed to appropriate services for people in need?
568,2016,Improve bus service (more frequent) & provide more bike paths that are not adjacent to traffic or shared with parked cars.
569,2016,IMPROVE CITY MAINTENANCE AND CLEANLINESS OF ROADS AND STREETS.
570,2016,Improve development services
571,2016,"I work downtown and do not feel safe walking around because of the large and growing homeless population. We need a coordinated effort by many agencies to find housing, training, rehab, healthcare and work for our homeless. It looks like a war zone driving by the shelters on Neches with people and trash everywhere and it is not safe for citizens to walk around the downtown area. They sleep in our gated property and sit right outside our office on the curb daily. Also, the traffic in Austin is ridiculous and the lack of public transportation needs improvements."
572,2016,"I would encourage the mayor to support a policy shift within APD, from a use of force model to one of de-escalation."
573,2016,I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AUSTIN PETS A LIVE A BETTER SHELTER.
574,2016,I would like to lead a none a day program pick up 1 piece of litter per day for all of Austin
575,2016,I would like to see realistic solutions for transportation issues in Austin - solutions with a potential of making it possible for large densities of people to move about the city safety and easily - like light rail and right sharing - have not been developed in viable ways to allow for sustainable and affordable growth in central Austin.
576,2016,I would like to see the trails at the parks have lighting at night so that people could feel safe walking the trail.
577,2016,"I would like you to focus on service provision to existing City of Austin residents and stop promoting the city to out of state ""potential residents"". The city's traffic patterns should show us that we are full!"
578,2016,I WOULD LOVE IF YOU WOULD PICK UP MORE THAN 1 TRASH CAN OF TRASH AND PICK UP CARDBOARD BOXES WHETHER FILLED OR UNFILLED
579,2016,I would love to see additional sand volleyball court at Zilker park or at least the current courts taken care of with new sand but doubling the amount of courts would be great.
580,2016,I would love to see more of a focus on quality education.
581,2016,I would request more police patrol in neighborhoods.
582,2016,"I would share with the Mayor that I love this city and it has become home to me, and while there is always room for improvement, it is a wonderful place to live!"
583,2016,"I would terminate everybody that has been associated with traffic planning, CAMPO, ""Smart Planning."" The Metropolitan Transportation org, etc. and start over with traffic and highway planning.  The same fools have run this for the last 40 years and no (zero) progress has been made.  Austin needs drastic measures and these fools are still running around looking at the same fictitious bicycle study thinking 3% of Austinites ride their bikes to work.  That number is more like 3 thousands of a percentage point.  There should be an immediate moratorium placed on all bicycle lane construction that results in a reduction in  the number of driving lanes for cars.  Capital Metro has the biggest flop in the country on its rail program per Forbes Magazine.  The train is in the wrong location and is a huge waste of money serving a very limited few.  MoPac and IH 35 are polluting parking lots for most of the day....always congested!  Finds some Ex-Bob Bullock employees.....they let get it done!!!  You could put mannequins in the seats of these current boards and departments and get about the same results!"
584,2016,I35 does not have enough lanes to support the traffic which causes the access roads to back up and makes life miserable when commuting.
585,2016,"I-35 problem overall, also enforcing a safer community in low income areas or areas of bad reputation like crime."
586,2016,IF IT'S NOT BROKE DON'T FIX IT. QUIT TRYING TO ADOPT EVERY SUGGESTION.

588,2016,If the train traveled to more locations there would be more people on the train and less traffic.
589,2016,"I'm a senior.  I notice there is only one question that even remotely relates to seniors.  I also notice that there are only 3 senior activity centers for the whole of Austin...none of which is near where I live.  I participate in several programs/classes at the Connelley-Guerrero Sr. Center, and drive 25-30 min to do so.  I whish the City would pay at least a little attention to senior citizen recreation needs.  For those of us who are seniors, the FREE activities are important.  Please consider our needs when you plan for the future of Austin as we pay taxes too.  Thank you."
590,2016,I'm concerned about police treatment in Austin of our citizens of color - I worry about their safety and hope our officers are trained to protect all of us.
591,2016,I'm concerned that young people cannot afford to rent apartments in Austin.
592,2016,"I'M NOT PASSIONATE ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES,BUT I THINK IF WE ARE GOING TO BAN PLASTIC BAGS. A SMALL BENEFIT TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN MY OPINION."
593,2016,"I'm pretty content with my living situation and the city; however, the cost of living continues to increase at an astounding rate. Rent shouldn't increase by a couple hundred dollars each year."
594,2016,I'm very confused why our city budget is significantly larger than Houston and Dallas and yet we have a much smaller population.  There is little logic in why we have to pay fees for Barton Springs and Deep Eddy.

621,2016,"It is time for the city of Austin to spend more time focused on infrastructure and supporting those that work in emergency services i.e. Police and fire. I am sick and tired of poor light sequencing, leaking water lines, leaking waste water lines, and in adequate  Storm water drains, etc... Just a thought.... the city of Austin should be required to meet the rigorous requirements placed on individuals and businesses."
622,2016,"In 2014 you told us we as a city were at a tipping-point...
Here's where we are missing the mark on affordability:
-Our property tax base grows as a result of more housing for an increasing population
-The growing base provides the city with a larger pool of money to run the city
-The city increases spending to account for the larger pool
We offer incentives to companies to relocate to Austin. They bring more jobs and more people to Austin. Our tax base expands, but the average resident does not get a slice of that pie. Instead, we pay more and more. To be sure, it is nice that our property values increase, but we are not seeing the benefits of 'our share' being a smaller slice of a growing pie. The pie grows and somehow the costs of the cut for the average guy goes up anyway.
Tell me again how we are further away from the tipping point today, instead of being closer to it?"

This city has a lot of people who struggle with expenses and yet the only relief is offered to those on the eastside. South Austin is losing businesses and residents.  Until the city finds a way to conduct business without wasting money on fluff projects that benefit only a few, I will have to consider moving outside the city. I cant afford your social experiments anymore."
646,2016,"It is getting too expensive to live in Austin. City officials say they want to reduce the cost, yet they continue to increase taxes and fees. The composting proposal is completely insane.

You can drive around West Austin and see no streets, medians, or sidewalks that are overgrown with weeds like the ones on streets east of I 35. City services in east of I 35 are not as plentiful as they are in West Austin. I am not talking about the section of Austin that is now being called ""East Austin"" that is being gentrified or the Mueller development.

826,2016,My car insurance went up 20% due to vehicle thefts and burglary. We need more street lights. Our neighborhood is VERY DARK at night
827,2016,My family cannot walk safely in our neighborhood because there are very few sidewalks and traffic is awful.
828,2016,"My fianc√© and I have lived in Austin our entire lives and are being pushed to the fringes just to survive. Wage increases and rent decreases will help with the infrastructure issues, unless you plan on having robots to serve food and drinks."
829,2016,"My neighborhood (Windsor Park) doesn't have very many sidewalks, yet a lot of people walk their dogs and take their kids and babies for walks on neighborhood streets without sidewalks anyway. Still, it would be really nice if the sidewalks that we do have could be more pedestrian-friendly. I am thinking specifically of Berkman Drive between the 290 frontage road and Briarcliff. There are a lot of bus stops on this stretch of Berkman, which is a main thoroughfare in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, there aren't really adequate trash bins for each of these bus stops. The ones that do exist often overflow, allowing trash to collect around the sidewalk and to blow into the front yards of houses (like mine) in close proximity to Berkman. Also, particularly the borders of the western side of Berkman, are often overgrown and not adequately mowed, so that the area of the sidewalk where you can actually walk is much narrower than it should be. I realize that this is a pretty trivial concern in the overall scheme of things, but I think clean streets really contribute to the well-being of neighborhoods. Citizens who walk more are healthier. Citizens who take the bus more have a smaller carbon footprint, and cleaner streets contribute to neighborhood pride and safer streets. I'd love to know how much the heavy city trash bins cost so that I could help my neighborhood raise money for some more. 
Overall, I am very happy with the efforts the City of Austin takes to conserve energy and water and to foster responsible growth, but I feel we still need to push harder for effective public transportation to the outer suburbs. We're a hot city and we're going to experience the effects of climate change in different ways than northern cities. I'd like to know we're doing everything we can to mitigate our carbon footprint on the environment. 
I obviously need to start going to city council meetings, but thank you for this opportunity to offer my feedback.

831,2016,"My wife and I live in NW Austin and am amazed at how long the major streets go without weed trimming. McNeil Drive for example has 3' weeds growing in the center blvd between 183 and the McNeil HS before they get mowed. Weeds are growing in the cracks of the non grass boulevard areas also. The weed roots damage masonry as they are looking bad. I see this Detroit type affect all over the city. This lack of maintenance makes Austin look run down. It seems like such an easy fix. Mow the grass and remove the weeds once a month. I know this takes money, but what a great visible way of showing our tax $$$ being used. Right now it looks like our tax dollars are NOT being used for this at all.  Simple monthly lawn maintenance would make Austin look like a well kept city. A pride thing.

856,2016,Need to hire more police.
857,2016,Need to plan for the growth and traffic this city is now experiencing much better.
858,2016,"Need to realize the city is growing. Restrictive zoning, city planning and code enforcement, city council and the mayor worsen out lives. Getting rid of Uber was totally incorrect. Not embracing light rail was a poor decision."
859,2016,"Need to rework zoning to improve traffic and add more public transit, especially to suburbs."
860,2016,Need Uber back! !!!!!!!!!!!
861,2016,Need way more space than one thing.  Coordinate growth management with AISD.

865,2016,"No development on Bull Creek, traffic will impossible, make it into park, at least some of it!"
866,2016,"No more affordable housing in areas that already have it,  make it a priority to locate this in areas that don't have any like West Austin. Let's make it affordable in every part of Austin and avoid creating an ""area of need"" for the schools and neighborhood."
867,2016,No more growth at any cost! TOO many people. Good Austin is gone!
868,2016,"NO MORE GROWTH, FOR PETE SAKE, TRAFFIC IS HORRIBLE"
869,2016,No more loitering allowed. The number of homeless has become extreme and is a danger (UT student death).
870,2016,"No more sanctuary city. No more trips to Amsterdam to look at a library.
Make cops stop driving police vehicles back and forth to work. Never pay another  company in money or tax breaks to come to Austin More fire, ems stations.
Lower water and light rates."
871,2016,No more tax giveaways to promote growth Austin will grow on its own
872,2016,NO MORE TOLL ROADS
873,2016,No satisfaction with utility company customer services.
874,2016,"No traffic planning.  the efforts on mopac are the joke of the city, and will be outdated before they are finished.  no e/w thru routs.
the silly communter train is a waste of money.  Simply start by building a link between downtown and the AIRPORT!"
875,2016,"Not all Austin residents are democrats, some are still republicans."
876,2016,NOT EVERYONE IN DIST 6 LIKES OR IS LIKE ZIMMERMAN
877,2016,NOT QUALIFIED TO GIVE GOOD ANSWER.
878,2016,Not to have so many events going on in Austin at the same time.
879,2016,NOV 2016 BOND PROPOSAL SHOULD BE VOTED DOWN JUST LIKE THE LAST BOND PROPOSAL
880,2016,"Now that Uber & Lyft are gone and traffic is becoming a bigger problem every day, a more extensive and reliable bus network would help us out a lot."
881,2016,Number of people moving into Austin is quickly affecting the courtesy of Austin residents.  The roads and water system will be adversely affected.  One disadvantage of a well run city and state.
882,2017,Lower home taxes.
883,2016,OLICE SHOULD ASSIST NOT HINDER ASSAULT BY NEIGHBOR CASEES
884,2016,"ONE IS NOT ENOUGH TERMINAL TAX ON HOMES FOR FUTURE FLOOD CONTROL, FORGET SUBWAYS OR PROCURE MORE REAL ESTATE TO PURSUE AND IF GOES FORWARD PROVIDE SERVICE TO SOUTH AUSTIN"
885,2016,Onion Creek flood protection.
886,2016,"Only main thing that bothered me and my neighborhood (even many city residents as far as I heard) is the city water prices. They seemed to be hiked recently and there is no good explanation. My usage has always been the same but now I am paying 4 or 5 time what I used to pay and I still not sure why. I contacted city of Austin for water, they came and checked and told me there is no leakage but I still have not answer for such huge water bill I am getting every month. I talked to my neighborhood and I am not alone."
887,2016,"Our code informant is so bad now. Not allowing for having at least certain situations being grandfathered in is ridiculous. I'm trying to buy a house right now that a permit was taken out in 1982 but never closed out, and it has been sold twice since that time but now I'm being held to handle it. Now I'm not sure if I can buy cause of it. It's so disheartening. Thank you for your time and consideration. Be safe."
888,2016,Our electric bill is sickening ($400 per month for a small 3/2 home). I feel that recent changes and fee structures with utilities takes advantage of consumers. We have no choice but to suffer through them.
889,2016,"Our lakes are full. and due to our yard and home value. We would like to water 2 times per week during the summer months. It is costing a fortune to keep our lovely yard presentable in our nice neighborhood to the extent that we will consider moving out of Austin (the city I love with all my heart. By following the rules we now need to spend about $6 to $7,000. to make our yard presentable."
890,2016,"Our property taxes keep increasing without reason, there are no improvements being made. And, Austin City Council needs to improve - there is to be a way to voice our views."
891,2016,Our public transport is incredibly deficient. We need to put time and money into making the light rail useful.
892,2016,OUR ROADS RAMPS SHOULDERS SIDEWALKS INTERSECTIONS THE BRIDGES ARE OFTEN NOT MOWED. OVER GROWTH WEEDS AND TRASH!
893,2016,Our streets and hwys are a mess! Get the bikes off the streets and improve traffic flow in and out of the city.
894,2016,"Our streets are so bad, you see the big dips in the road."
895,2016,"Our Traffic Sucks!!!  Stop wasting our precious tax dollars on companies that can't get the job done like MoPac for instance. BTW, is mine & my neighbors tax dollars paying them for running a year over project?  Michael Dell seems to be able to get things done very quickly up in his neighborhood.  That just never seems to happen in SW AUSTIN. This use to be such an AWESOME place to live but you just keep raising our taxes and allowing hundreds of new folks move into our Beautiful city everyday with NO traffic infrastructure vision in place. What is our city government doing with all this money? Something is just not working any more in what use to be one of the most fantastic cities in the country. You double the value of my property this past year yet I don't have street lights or sidewalks in my neighborhood. Could that be why crime is getting so bad?  It's so dark who can see the burglars. I'm very sad for my Beautiful Austin, you guys are doing something's or budgeting very poorly with all this tax money. Where is the accountability? You build roads that we agree we will pay for with tolls & you can't even get that right!  I would like to know where accountability comes in? Probably billions of dollars spent all over the city for contracts signed that run over but you folks or road construction folks are NEVER held accountable. So I guess they don't care if they complete these jobs on time or not. Us tax payers will make sure they still get paid every night!  I love being on MoPac parking lot returning home on a Sunday night from dropping off my grandkids in a SINGLE LANE OF TRAFFIC (after how many years of construction). Watch 6 guys standing around talking, smoking cigarettes figuring out what to do next I guess. Watching my hard earn money (taxes) being put to such a terrible waste. To say I am disillusioned with your governments poor decisions in my Austin, is an understatement!!  I am sure most long time residents and Austinites a like feel exactly the same way. Shame on you government folks making these awful decisions, having no accountability and still keep your jobs.... 
BTW for all the additional people moving into our city I think Austin police & fire personnel and Austin Utilities & waste management do an excellent job!!!"
896,2016,Our water bills are not trust worthy. Water is too expensive and there is no recourse if it is wrong.
897,2016,Over populated.
898,2016,OVERALL GOOD JOB. IT'S JUST GETTING TOO CROWDED HERE.
899,2016,Overall living costs in Austin are too high!
900,2016,"Overall, the City offices are pretty good - they are always sweet and polite on the phone and 3-1-1 is very informative."
901,2016,Overcome traffic and public transportation issues in a  quick and affordable manner for the taxpayers of Austin
902,2016,"PARKS ARE IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY HANCOCK GOLF COURSE FOR GOLF, WALKING DOG, JOGGERS AND BEAUTIFUL SCENERY"

904,2016,Pay closer attention to the Four Points area - extreme traffic congestion that is only getting worse!
905,2016,PAY MORE ATTENTION TO CARS AND TRUCKS LESS TO BICYCLES. REDUCE PROPERTY RAXES.
906,2016,"Pay rates for fire and police personnel are too high for a city the size of Austin.  Mayor and Council seem to be consistently cowed by the unions and bow to their demands.  The  fire department needs to be held accountable for their poor efforts in recruiting women and minorities, and REALLY show some improvements before any more benefit and pay increases are granted.   I find it interesting that there were questions in this survey about emergency responses and EMS.  I wonder how many citizens realize that MOST fire department responses are for medical emergencies, not fires.  I would like to understand why it makes sense to dispatch a large truck with a full complement of fire fighters to a medical emergency, which is then almost always followed by an EMS response.   If it's because EMS lacks the resources to respond to all medical emergencies quickly enough, then some of the resources now allocated to AFD need to be redirected to EMS."
907,2016,Pay rates should at least match the cost of living in Austin.
908,2016,"People in my neighborhood drive 40-50 up Scotland Well Drive, the speed limit is 30!"
909,2016,People speed through the residential neighborhoods and do not drive 25 which would help reduce accidents or animals being run over. I have lost 3-4 over the years. Would like slower speeds limits in residential neighborhoods and enforced. Thanks!
910,2016,"PERMITTING IS A DISASTER, MAJOR CONSTRAINT"

919,2016,PLEAS WORK WITH APD TO TRAIN ORFFICERS TO DE-ESCALTER
920,2016,Please  clean up and broaden city sidewalks and expand walking trail/biking trails.
921,2016,"Please  please reevaluate the Imagine Austin plan which is allowing out of town investors creating PUDs in our beloved neighborhoods without giving much thought nor care to the existing residents. Even having gone through neighborhood charities, the takeaway is that they are only going through the motions and will drag out the process to eventually build whatever they want at the expensive of nearby neighborhoods."
922,2016,"Please ""un-gerrymander"" our election districts. City of Austin is diluted & divided by rural edges."
923,2016,PLEASE ADD MORE PERSONNEL TO HANDLE UTILITIES CUSTOMER SERVICE. WEBSITE THE WAIT IS TERRIBLE.
924,2016,"please address the issue of cars with sound systems that are a distraction and annoyance while on the road,  add to noise pollution in the city and disrupt the peace in residential areas  and prevent people from being able to sleep."
925,2016,PLEASE ADDRESS THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION
926,2016,Please address traffic on I35 and Mopac. Discount  I30 toll for big rigs  and make the new toll lane on Mopac a regular lane to help with traffic flow 24-7.
927,2016,PLEASE AIM FOR GREEN ROOF OR SOLAR ROOFS. LIKE IN FRANCE.
928,2016,"Please ban short term rental (AIRBNB and Home away) or come up with new laws.  We live in a small condo complex in a neighborhood that was once quiet.  The unit upstairs is being used as a STR.  Furthermore, the house next door is rented out through AIRBNB.  There is constant traffic and noise pollution.  HOA will do nothing about the situation in our condo complex.  Furthermore, the house next door is constantly throwing parties.  We called 311 for over a year regarding after hours noise violations.  Nothing is being done and the unit upstairs continues to operate as a STR even after over a year of complaining.  This is a historic residential neighborhood.  Homeowners are being victimized.  Neighborhoods and hotels are separated for a reason.  The city council voted to ban STR but not till 2020.  How are homeowners supposed to live under these conditions? I am sure this comment will either be laughed at or ignored.  However, unless you are faced with these conditions, you will never understand what it feels like.  It is horrific."
929,2016,"Please be sure we have top notch police, fire & medical services."
930,2016,Please clean up creek beds & neighborhood streets & remove dead leaves in your right of way & city owned property.
931,2016,Please compost!
932,2016,Please consider providing either a reliable park and ride system or light rail system in the future. I'm astounded at how much my property taxes have increased over the past couple of years. I would like to gave seen the money I paid go towards improving our traffic  structure/management both in and around downtown Austin.
933,2016,"Please consider setting limits to the development growth of Austin (urban sprawling).  This is a d√©j√†-vu of what happened in Northern California in the nineties, where every patch of grass was developed. Austin has a unique charm, with high quality customer service,  and great quality of life that will quickly deteriorate with this rapid urban sprawl. It's wonderful that everyone loves Austin, but let's develop the suburbs, because at this rate we will lose what makes Austin ."
934,2016,Please cut the budget.  Please lower taxes.  We don't need pretty streets or arts in the park if we can't afford to remain in our homes.
935,2016,"Please do not provide 24 hour notice of restaurant inspections!! Please enforce watering restrictions, this is doable. Please fix building permit processes, it's crooked!"
936,2016,"Please do something about the traffic, (especially 35 & Mopac)."
937,2016,Please do something about these city streets! They cause motorists to suffer the cost for repairs due to the terrible street conditions.
938,2016,PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT TRAFFIC! TOO MANY CARS ON ROADS BUILT TO HANDLE LESS TRAFFIC.
939,2016,Please do something to improve traffic.
940,2016,"Please do what you can to keep Austin affordable for the middle class (most importantly in home ownership), enforce codes (i.e. construction should NOT be happening on Sunday), and keep those roads moving! Thank you for all you do."
941,2016,"Please don't change the zoning of our single family neighborhood to allow for multi-family structures. I live close to Burnet Rd. and have heard about the implications of Code Next and am quite unhappy about the possibility of row houses going up next door.  People who own homes in this town have rights that shouldn't be diminished because developers want to profit and build over what we used to know as Austin. We are taxed at such high rates (thanks, legislature), but have this encroachment as an added insult. We will have to move out of the neighborhood and possibly the city when we retire simply because of taxes (and perhaps row houses). As a native Austinite, that stings. The dollars that we will get for our home some day can't replace the feeling of connection to our community we've invested so much time in that will be lost when we can no longer live here."
942,2016,Please don't make us pay %5/month for composting.
943,2016,Please don't tax me out of my home
944,2016,"Please don't turn mopac  into an alternative to 35. I love Barton Springs, and don't want the extra traffic over the recharge zone. Thanks!"

959,2016,"Please fix the transportation issues in Austin for CARS - i.e. - create rail to get some off the road/build more roads to handle those that are on the road, along with other things like sidewalks and bike lanes.   If this is not resolved Austin will no longer be a great place to live."

973,2016,Please help keep our new streets clean and enforce speed limits.
974,2016,"Please help make the city safer! In the past several years, perhaps because of all of the out of towners, we've experienced multiple incidents that make us feel Austin is not as safe as it was in the 90s-00s. For example, the rearview window of our car was broken when we were out recently (I think it happened to many cars in Lakeline Mall that weekend, though we weren't at the mall). Downtown is much less safe; ""dirty Sixth"" is really dirty now with fights and even gun violence! We are concerned about these issues for the safety of our family and community."
975,2016,PLEASE HELP PROTECT OLDER NEIGHBORHOODS FROM TEAR DOWN. OLD FOLKS NEED OUR HOMES.

980,2016,PLEASE IDENTIFY AUSTIN CULTURE LIVE MUSIC.
981,2016,"Please improve / revamp the light rail service. It should cover important city areas like UT campus, Downtown, ABIA. That would take a lot of traffic off I-35, Mopac and 183 instead widening with toll roads such highways. Austin will keep growing and with that we will have more cars on those roads and you can't keep adding lanes forever."

990,2016,"Please invest in building out our public transit system. Yes, it is a very expensive endeavor, but it will only get more expensive in the future. It is also a major contributing factor to the affordability problem in Austin. Until we build out our public transit system, we will not be able to build to the density required to provide affordable housing in the city limits. Rail or gondolas or dedicated lanes for the bus system. Please invest in something that isn't car-based, because car-based investment can only become prohibitively congested long before we've reached the density to attempt any sustainable solution to our affordability crisis.

1028,2016,"Please start to understand economics, the more you spend on different programs outside of what should be city responsibilities, the more taxes go up and the more unaffordable the city becomes.  Every dollar counts and the city seems to be fond of saying ""it will only raise taxes by a few dollars "".  We should be concerned that our city budget is that Dallas and San Antonio.  That's ridiculous!"
1029,2016,"Please stop adding new fees, costs, etc. to utility bills or sell Austin Energy and get rid of the monopoly. Utility bills should only reflect the costs of that utility and not overcharge so the city can pay for other things out of general funds. We are in the county, but pay for items from utilities. If I did this in my business, I would be filling out the form out from jail!"
1030,2016,"Please stop claiming Austin is great place to live.  It's okay... unfortunately the aspects that made Austin fun and unique have been destroyed by business greed, high property taxes, unaffordable housing, and inadequate transportation options."

Heat pumps are more efficient than gas yet $1000 of the rebate comes if you burn gas.

At any given moment, during rush hour traffic, there are hundreds of Semi-Trucks in IH-35 in the Austin City Limits.  Imagine four more open miles of road during rush hour.

The bartenders are reckless and over serve and then we wonder why there are so many drunk driving incidents. Raise the minimum wage, or provide a cheaper alternative of health insurance to those within the service industry. Crack down on bars and restaurants not paying their staff what they are owed, this means paying minimum wage when servers don't make enough tips to average an hourly wage that equals minimum wage. Austin is lauded as this beautiful city with festivals and so many things to do yet those who tirelessly serve in the service industry , usually those who end up working all these events, can't afford any of the amenities, much less rent, or less health care.  The rent gouge has got to stop. The people who have helped create this beautiful town are being forced out. It's really sad."

We would love for my wife to stop working to care for our child, but we do not think we could afford it.  The City of Austin needs to STOP doing so much extra stuff and just focus on the basics and streamlining processes to accomplish more with the same number of employees.  Also, the City leadership needs to work with the other taxing entities to REDUCE the per household property tax burden by changing how the State of Texas funds public education by taking money from property rich districts.  A statewide sales tax for education would be much more fair.  STOP doing so many affordability programs that just increase property tax and/or utility tax burden."

With the number of lakes, rivers and swimming pools in Austin, I feel it is important to teach young people how to swim, to save their lives in an emergency situation. There have been many cases of drowning in the Austin area recently. I would like to see free swim lessons again in Austin. 
Flooding has been a major issue in Austin. More needs to be done to control the growth of the City. It is growing too quickly. Apartment houses with major populations are exploding over the city, with little regard for the increase in traffic. Traffic lights at entrance/exits to apartment complexes might help."
1260,2016,SYNCHRONIZED TRAFFIC CONTROL.
1261,2016,Take a long term view.
1262,2016,TAKE BETTER CARE OF THE HOMELESS! THEY ARE PEOPLE TOO!
1263,2016,THE EDWARDS AQUIFER AND OTHER SPRINGS ARE THE LIFE BLOOD OF THIS AREA. PLEASE PROTECT THEM.
1264,2016,"The electric bill rates are getting too high and are not as affordable as they were in the past.  Need to work on traffic congestion.  Affordable housing is also a problem- the rents are getting too high and are hard for families to afford. Also, daycare expenses for families are high in the city and programs to help families with childcare are needed."
1265,2016,"Take better care of the poor addicted disenfranchised people - help get them in programs and off the drugs, off the streets.   Austin does so many things right, but there are many  many vagrants / beggars / homeless /dealer/addicts  - mini squatter settlements under 35 and always around the town lake trail --  do they need drug rehab? job training? housing?  all of the above?   It especially makes me very sad to see the people outside the arch - predominantly African American -- Austin can not consider itself a progressive inclusive city while Black folks are living in such poverty.   Whatever social services people need to get back on their feet and become part of this vibrant economy --- do it!!!   
AND PLEASE GIVE US SAFE BIKE LANES THAT ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED FROM CARS - THIS COULD BE A TOTAL BIKING CITY YEAR ROUND.   thank you."
1266,2016,TAKE CARE OF OUR COPS AND STAND BEHIND THEM AND SUPPORT THEM.

1271,2016,Taxes for retired are horrible.

1275,2016,"Taxes/expenses go up, services go down."
1276,2016,Teach police how to deal with diverse population so they don't shoot people of color or mentally ill persons first & then cry that they were scared for their lives.  You should not be in law enforcement if you're a scary cat.
1277,2016,Tell police to stop besting up and killing minorities.
1278,2016,Texas should legalize marijuana.
1279,2016,THANK YOU & YOUR STAFF & CITY COUNCIL FOR RELENTLESSLY WORKING FOR AUSTIN RESIDENTS
1280,2016,thank you for all your hard work and kindness
1281,2016,"Thank you for caring about feedback but more importantly for working to make Austin the great place it is. I'd welcome some planning on making our airport into a larger, truly international transportation hub. We are the capital of one of the largest states in the union. Let's make it easy to get here on a global scale. No one wants to go through DFW."
1282,2016,THANK YOU FOR CARING ABOUT YOUR LOW INCOME POPULATION AND PLEASE DON'T FORGET US IN YOUR RUSH TO GROW AUSTIN.
1283,2016,thank you for trying to deal with our traffic situation
1284,2016,Thank you for working on major highway traffic flow and increased public transportation!
1285,2016,Thank you for your sensible bond (traffic) proposal. I want to see cost effective solutions for opening existing corridors and avoiding toll roads.
1286,2016,THANKS FOR SPEAKING AT ORLANDO VIGIL. MORE CITY PARKS PLEASE!
1287,2016,"That in the future, all construction of multi-family buildings strive for Gold or Platinum LEED designation or at the very least there is grey water collection which can be used for watering of landscaping, solar panels, on-demand hot water units, thermal paned glass and xeriscaping.
I am concerned that burgeoning building on So. Lamar, Congress Ave. and Downtown is putting a terrible strain on water availability.  The city has doubled in size since I moved here in 1999 and the population continues to increase at a staggering rate.  
Thank you."
1288,2016,"The ""progress"" and development of Austin...It seems Austin has lost its way, is rapidly losing its identity and even more rapidly, with all the buildings being put up (and I do mean UP,) Austin is losing its sky."
1289,2016,The 311 operators need to not MAKE UP time estimates when power is off. I threw away $500 of food from my refrigerator based on their inaccurate information.
1290,2016,"The 311 requests do not get handled - multiple attempts and weeks needed to get things done., e.g., painting street lines, clearing weeds."
1291,2016,"the 311 system stinks. Do what Boston did: no new office or condo construction until occupancy reached 85% all of Austin.  And dear god, stop using Zilker Park for festivals."
1292,2016,Tiny reductions in property tax which hurt funding for services like parks and libraries are stupid.
1293,2016,"The amount charged for electrical and water services.  My water bill went from $25.00 in June 2015 to $78.00 in June 2015.  The months in 2015 June, July, and August were just as bad.  When I called the person I spoke to just told me I had used more water during those months.  That is all he would say.  I told him nothing changed, number of people living here, no swimming poll, no grass watering etc.  He just blew me off.  I got behind in my electric bill and they agreed to put me on a payment plan.  I was 1 day late in getting my payment in and they pulled me off the plan and told me that I had to come up with $580.00 dollars then they would add $78 dollars to my regular electric bill.  I am 72 years of age and on a fixed income, I certainly had to do without a lot of things the get the money that was required.  Being 1 day late is no reason to punish anyone."
1294,2016,"The amount of rent charged in certain areas being gentrified is ridiculous, particularly in East Austin. I should not be paying such a steep price to live on Riverside when it's been neglected for years."
1295,2016,THE BUS ROUTES UP AND DOWN LAMAR BLVD SHOULD COME EVERY 5 MINUTES DURING THE RUSH HOUR MAKE EVERY STOP ALL THE WAY UP AND DOWN.
1296,2016,"The city council would be well advised to stop attempting to micro manage every aspect of it's citizens' lives, dispense with their failed attempts at social engineering, and terminate their bizarre love affair with bicycles and bike lanes (which they pursue to the exclusion of addressing and mitigating real traffic issues.)  The city's commitment to making Austin affordable is laughable, as every step they take has exactly the opposite effect."
1297,2016,"The city has a great app for 311 tasks, but there doesn't seem to be any repercussions if the item is closed without performing the task. Emails to city staff (all departments, as a civilian or professional) go unanswered. As a professional engineer who walks the neighborhood every day, I have specific  ways to cheaply improve the neighborhood, but it's impossible to pass on that info onto the CoA people who will take care of it. How many others like me could help, but aren't being heard?"
1298,2016,The city is apparently not interested in pursuing and is apparently willing to totally ignore the resolution of grievances of residents who have been negatively impacted by faulty work done by city employees.
1299,2016,"The city is becoming unaffordable and hostile to minorities and lower-income residents.  The income disparity is ridiculous and harmful to the city as a whole.  It's becoming difficult for me to remain here, and I am thinking about leaving."
1300,2016,"The city is booming, and people want the Austin experience even though we may have to live further out. I'd like to see zoning/codes changed to allow for more small business in the south Austin area."
1301,2016,"The city is losing its identity as a home to artists and a place where lower income people can live and thrive. The Mueller development is a perfect example where the city had an amazing chance to build a community of local and small businesses, instead we favored putting in Best Buy, Staples, Wells Fargo, Starbucks, and other stores that mark the wasteland of non-identity. It's really sad to see this town lose its individuality and the thing that made it special. We need leadership with a progressive vision that can embrace responsible growth and double down on a progressive agenda towards renewable energy and an effective transportation plan that does not rely on more roads and highways for cars."
1302,2016,The city is terrible about completing projects on time and on budget.
1303,2016,"THE CITY MAKES DECISIONS FOR VERY SMALL GROUPS THAT AFFECT THE MINORITY NEGATIVE. THIS CITY LOOKS LIKE A DUMP WITH FLEA MARKETS,TRASH,FOOD TRUCK TRASH AND NO AREAS MOWED FOR MONTHS."
1304,2016,The city must become more affordable and the public school system must improve.
1305,2016,THE CITY NEED TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRIORITY.
1306,2016,"The city needs a more comprehensive and better connected transportation network including bus, rail, bike, pedestrian access."
1307,2016,The City needs more subsidized housing. Affordable housing is still not affordable for our lower income families.
1308,2016,THE CITY NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN FOR THE ROADS AND OT TOLL ROADS
1309,2016,The city needs to get the cost for all utilities and taxes down. Use common sense on when and how much water restrictions.
1310,2016,"The electric company and water company appear to be unethical, unaccountable, rude And uncaring! I don't trust them nor any officials from water and electricity in other words Austin Utilities is a self serving fraudulent company. Property taxes are so hi elders like myself can barely hold on to their homes while scoops cry poor! It seems filled with graft
The regulatory and this service part of Austin makes me think of moving at my age. Shame on you!"
1311,2016,"The electric, water, waist water, street, drainage etc all the extra items list are taxes in excess!!!"
1312,2016,The electricity costs are too high!
1313,2016,To execute fairness in property taxes
1314,2016,"The city needs to play a stronger role in creating an Austin that everyone can afford to live in, not just the upper-middle class and rich. I recently was at a meeting w/ Neighborhood Housing and Community Development where they presented Austin's Housing Plan and more than half of the units (40k out of 75k) are slated to be Market Rate!....and this stat was under the heading ""10 Year¬†Affordable Housing¬†Goals¬†&¬†Targets"". Seriously!?! How does this happen!?! The market rate units have happened, have destroyed neighborhoods, and will continue to happen without NHCD's assistance. 
This is the reason why Austin currently has almost half the number of Black people here as when I was growing up. I honestly don't understand how this process went through any kind of thorough community engagement and this is the result we have. I think the solutions lie in recruiting a diverse city staff (especially in NHCD), hiring diverse consultants that are able to reach the people most impacted by the city's plans (even if that means holding public engagement events in cities like Manor, Elgin and Del Valle, which have been the recipients of our lower-income people of color), and again, putting our money where our mouth is. 
The city likes to think of itself as a liberal beacon of light, but the reality is that we are the most economically segregated metro area in the country AND the only city in the country with double-digit population growth and a declining Black population. If we want to walk the talk we need to invest as much time, resources, and energy in bringing back diversity as we do trying to attract tech companies and act cool. 
Thank you kindly,
Ruthie Redmond"
1315,2016,THE CITY OF AUSTIN EITHER HAS TO WIDEN IT'S HIGHWAY LANES AND OR PROVIDE ANOTHER FORM OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
1316,2016,THE CITY OF AUSTIN NEEDS TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE IN ORDER FOR LONG TIME RESIDENTS OF AUSTIN TO BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN AUSTIN
1317,2016,"The city of Austin never seems to plan for future travel problems, we are always in the reacting mode. by the time you get a road built it is already obsolete."
1318,2016,"The City of Austin really needs to improve its Vector services with regard to rat control.  I used to live in Austin in the 90's and moved back 2 years ago.  I can't believe how the rat population has exploded exponentially and nothing other than hiring costly private companies as a quick fix to one residence is the only thing the city of Austin seems to be doing.  When we moved here to a newly, fully renovated home in a nice neighborhood, we shortly discovered the house was infested with rats in the walls and attic.  Apparently it was a problem that could never get fully resolved bc of the tenacity of the rats to get back in to the home.  I soon learned how many friends and acquaintances (and in their personal experience) that the rat problem in people's homes is all too common and all too costly to eradicate. The City of Austin REALLY needs to implement the same type of chemical sterilization program that New York City and Chicago have implemented to control their rat problems.   It the only way to get that rat population under control as a critical compliment to the work that the private pest control companies are doing."
1319,2016,The City of Austin Utility system is corrupt!!!! We had a COA employee admit that one of their employees (meter reader) actually lied about our meter reading and COA still insists that we pay for services we DID NOT USE! COA utilities gouges prices and nothing is being done about this corruption!
1320,2016,Too many toll roads.
1321,2016,THE CITY SEEMS TO ONLY PLAN TRAFFIC FLOW ABOUT 5 MONTHS AHEAD. SO THOSE FIXES ARE ABSOLETE AS SOON AS THEY ARE COMPLETED.
1322,2016,"The city should be the business of protecting citizens, providing safe streets, providing utilities, collecting garbage.....even when they have to stoop over and pick up an item or two!  Also, keeping streets and parks clean, lights burning,  crime controlled.  The basics.  The city wastes so much money on trying to give away things to make people feel good!  Provide decent housing and jobs and people will feel good about themselves.  Way, way too much spent on a new library and there will be no place to park.  There is no parking now in Austin and then they tell us that our neighborhoods may get metered.  GREED is what drives the city not common sense and adequate services.  Too much money spent on music festivals, trash cleanup and catering to the young.  The senior centers are not even open much now because they want us to believe the city cannot afford them.  Hogwash!  The city can afford funds for all the nonsense of the council interests, their offices, their pet projects.  I remember the days when we all worked together!  Now the staff get in the way.  Too many staff, no parking, no parking, no parking!!!! and so on.  And now for TRAFFIC.  well,  you get the message.  You are not doing a very good job of maintaining common sense services.  We go to other cities and can get around, use Uber, find a place to park (oh yes, heaven forbid other cities have parking lots - those things that the snooty folks tell us look bad) and services to h ell you get around - lots of maps, oh, so much more than we have here.  We have lost the opportunity to be a great city.  Now we are settling for a crowded city with high taxes, most everyone forced out of town and so many ordinances that who knows what to enforce!"
1323,2016,The city should provide free housing for homeless people as Seattle does. It saves money in the long run.
1324,2016,"The city wastes too much money on feel good stuff (bike lanes, bridges). Wastewater fees are way too high. So is water. I don't trust city utilities. Overcharges & city wastes the money."
1325,2016,"the city's growing rapidly, antiquated organizational process is the biggest issue. Don't lose the momentum we have but really focus on long term  goals."
1326,2016,"The permitting process needs to be updated--should be more electronic. It is too difficult, slow, cumbersome and costs businesses too much time."
1327,2016,"To find one thing, beautiful city and I really like living here but the COA employees are as bad as I have every seen about returning phone calls."
1328,2016,"The construction of our metro system is fundamentally flawed. It serves a population that is affluent, i.e., flush with motor vehicles who don't need to use public transit, except for when they want to come downtown and drink, but not face charges of a DUI/DWI. Public transit is a must in the modern Austin. The failure of this city to provide a metro line to south Austin is mind-boggling. Furthermore, the city has failed to even provide a metro line for UT students, who are the largest demographic in this city that would benefit from a metro line. The metro line as it exists is not serving a tourist population, because it runs from Leander (which is too far for most tourists) to the convention center (which is not a tourist destination for anyone coming from north Austin). I urge you to push for stronger legislation for a metro line, no matter how strong the gas and oil lobby is, no matter what the city council says. We need it. Pedestrian deaths, traffic times - everything is getting worse without it. If you truly serve this city, if you truly are a representative for those who cannot represent themselves, then you'll help us address this grave problem."
1329,2016,"The cost for utilities (electric, water, waste water, gas, and trash) is so high that we may be moving to a more affordable city nearby.  Additionally, the droughts in the last 5-6 years were managed VERY poorly by the city resulting in a request for water conversation AND a significant increase in cost.  The messaging that we received from the city is that the majority of residence helped the Water Department have a successful conservation program, but the result is that we paid more for it.  The cost for gas is going up exponentially and I don't trust the city management or utility department about why.  
After dealing with 10 years of traffic issues I have given up on the City Management on choosing measures that will help reduce the amount of traffic on I-35, Mopac, or any of the major streets.  Even more, the need to propose and award projects to the businesses who donate the most money to the City Hall members and their election efforts is leading to more and more distrust within the community.  Also, the City's need to over-regulate has chased away two of the largest traffic congestion options - Uber and Lyft, shows that there is more of an interest in the City earning dollars on businesses in town instead of helping to resolve the problems.  Multiple TNCs have opened in town, but it has been 4 months since Uber & Lyft left town and the driving availability and cost of using the current TNCs is led more people to drive on their own, congest more traffic, take up more parking spots, or simply stay home where the city loses out on a LOT of tax dollars. 
None of the above complaints are new to the city, it's managers, and utility departments.  What matters is whether or not they decide to listen to the results of this survey.  If this data is not used to better our city and communities I will not be surprised, but will be disappointed nonetheless."
1330,2016,The cost of living here is insane. The city is great but it seems ridiculously unproportional for a single person to survive on their own in comparison to most cities.
1331,2016,"The cost of living in Austin has sky-rocketed, and local businesses are not able or willing to meet the financial needs of the lower-middle class. In order to live a comfortable life in Austin, it seems you must be either a lawyer, an engineer, a doctor, or otherwise come from old Austin money. The culture that Austin so prides itself upon is being systematically pushed out."
1332,2016,"THE COST OF LIVING IN AUSTIN IS JUST TOO HIGH, I'LL HAVE TO MOVE WHEN I RETIRE FROM MY JOB"
1333,2016,THE COST OF LIVING IN AUSTIN IS VERY HIGH.
1334,2016,The cost of living in my city is unreasonable. I feel like I cannot afford to live in the city I grew up in.
1335,2016,The main highways (Mopac and IH35) need more lanes.
1336,2016,The mayor is a racist with a gun.
1337,2017,BUILD MORE LANES ON FM 620
1338,2016,"The cost of living is Austin is growing so much faster than the rate of pay. Austin is a great place, but I may have to leave because it is becoming harder and harder to afford basic living. It's also unreasonable to have to move an hour or more outside of the city to afford a home, especially with the amount of traffic during your commute."
1339,2016,The cost of living is too expensive.
1340,2016,The cost of utilities and taxes are forcing medium income families out of this city.
1341,2016,The cost or water is excessive and way too high.
1342,2016,The crime in our neighborhood is out of control.  Every night we have break ins.  I have myself been held up at gunpoint.  The cops show up late and we have zero follow up form detectives even when we get these guys on video.   I have written multiple letters and emails to councilman Renteria and not even received an acknowledgement more less a reply.  Our taxes have doubled over the past year and so have the crime and police response time.
1343,2016,"The cure to Austin's traffic problem is better walking sidewalks. rail and bike paths. We need to get people out of their vehicles and improve the quality of that experience, not find ways to speed up the vehicle traffic. A visit to Portland, Seattle or especially Shanghai would be enlightening."
1344,2016,"The declining availability of affordable housing in Austin will force the out the young, energetic, creative and innovative people who make this a special place to live, which would be a shame.
I strongly encourage you to continue your fight to have commercial buildings assessed properly so that businesses pay their fare share of property taxes.
Sorry that is two things."
1345,2016,"The development planning and review department is the worst excuse for ""services"" at the city. Rife with conflicts of interests, shady back room dealings, pay for privilege, inept process with exorbitant fees and delays. Every single employee should be fired and replaced, and the office should be built from the ground up to function correctly."
1346,2016,"The fact that it takes me 10-12 minutes to get to work and 30-60 to get home is a daily and significant cause of dissatisfaction in my life.  It's only traffic - but day in and day out, it really wears on you.
Whoever buys the children's library collection in Spanish is amazing!  I am a teacher and I am continually impressed.  I refer the families at my school to the Public Library all the time.  One time, I dropped my University of Texas Library books off at APL by mistake and I got a personalized email and phone call from the library within hours - in Spanish (the language of the materials in question).  Keep up the good work!"
1347,2016,The fact that Uber and Lyft are no longer here is crazy!  Please do something to get them back!  The council members looked like crazies in their ads!
1348,2016,"The fluoride in the city's drinking water is my number one concern/complaint about the city. We deserve clean drinking water, not poisoned with endocrine disruptors and neurotoxins."
1349,2016,"THE GROVE AS PROPOSED IS TOO BIG, IT WILL ONLY ADD TO CITY GRNDCO CK, MORE HOUSING, TREES,FLOWERS, OFFICES. WHERE DOES ALL THE MONEY GO? WE PAY MORE IN TAXED EVERY YEAR BUT STILL STREETS HAVE POTHOLES, THERE';S NOT ENOUGH SIDEWALKS OR FIREMAN, POOLS ARE CLOSED FOR LACK OF STAFF ETC"
1350,2016,The hard water in Clarksville is so difficult to have healthy skin and hair and shower well. It also causes poor hot water conditions. It's awful!
1351,2016,The highways need a major overhaul. There's too much traffic.
1352,2016,"The homeless population downtown is growing in size, as well as aggressiveness. It makes the city feel less safe."
1353,2016,THE HOMELESS POPULATION NEEDS MORE HELP/ATTENTION
1354,2016,"The homeowner taxes are forcing us to move. It is insane how high the taxes are. Furthermore- in addition to taxes now we are asked to pay over 200 dollars per child per year to public schools for fees? What are my taxes for!?! I love Austin and I am a lifelong Texan, but as a family of six earning 120k per year we can't afford to keep
Our modest home due to taxes. Please fix this!!!!"
1355,2016,"The idea of raising taxes on a percentage of the population to make living in the city ""more affordable"" is an absurd concept! The basic idea reduces the affordability for  a greater portion of the citizens. Reinforcing this concept includes the toll roads which now, and will continue to encircle, the city. The people who need to live out of the density of Austin and commute, are the folks who cannot afford to pay exorbitant tolls trying to get to work. This continues to create an economic and/or time barrier for lower income people.  I believe in equal economic opportunity for all people in Austin and not artificial props and machinations to create ""fairness"".   
There is definitely a condition of  special interests and cronyism that direct the Austin political scene which doesn't always serve the best interests of its citizenry. A huge example is the 'Push' for bicycle commuting, which families with small children, elder citizens, handicapped citizens, people that need to wear appropriate clothes to work, people who carry tools and machinery as part of their trade  and on and on...THESE people make up the vast group of commuters...They cannot ride a bike to work! Streets have been redesigned at great expense, and creation of less lanes for moving vehicle traffic, to be left unused daily by the intended bicycle users.
There are many other examples of poorly designed ideas for a community the size of our city."
1356,2016,"The key to solving the problem of traffic is to make driving MORE inconvenient, and to make public transport, cycling and walking easier and cheaper."
1357,2016,The lack of affordable housing in Austin has pushed many of the original Austinites out of the city. The City of Austin caters to those that recently moved here and has not listened to those that were born and raised here. The family and kid friendly city no longer exist.
1358,2016,THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF MAJOR PARKS DURING MILD SEASONS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.
1359,2016,"THE LOWER INCOME CITIZENS ARE BEING PRICED OUT OF THE CITY,SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING."
1360,2016,The mayor should be more inclusive to the overall population of city residents than less inclusive when establishing policies and services.
1361,2016,THE MCMANSION CODES ARE NOT ADHERED TO IN THE WEST AUSTIN NEIGHBORHOODS AND AS A RESULT WE ARE LOSING THE TREES AND CHARM THAT GIVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD ITS DISTINCTIVE QUALITIES
1362,2016,The method of paving/resurfacing older streets is not appropriate and is not holding up.
1363,2016,The middle class (and low income households) can't afford to buy a house in Austin.
1364,2016,The permitting process has got to improve.  Wasn't this your platform?  You're costing people too much money due to delayed permits - not cool.
1365,2016,Traffic control
1366,2016,"The police are too reactive and authoritarian.  Police are to protect and serve and although my interactions have on the whole been satisfactory, there is low tolerance for unattached males in general.  Austin has become a more violent city and it's not clear if this is a response to the reactiveness of the police or if police are  reacting to a more violent city.  In general society has become more violent in the last 30 years and it reflects in the police and the populace.  Nevertheless, the police have a duty and obligation to operate on a higher standard of restraint in dealing with the populace.  That is something that needs to be more effectively addressed by the APD."
1367,2016,The price of homes and real estate taxes are way too high!
1368,2016,The price of water is ridiculous- especially for a large household of 7 paying under the tiered pricing structure.  The charge should be limited to its cost of production instead of being a hidden tax on large families.
1369,2016,THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 15TH AND LAMAR ARE NOT CLEAN. WEEDS ARE 5 FT HIGH.
1370,2016,THE RESPONSE TIME FOR 311 CALLS COMPLAINTS IS EXTREMELY SLOW.
1371,2016,The road would be safer with more trimming of weeds & trees.
1372,2016,"The roadwork must be done at a faster pace to prevent traffic, frustration and hazard. It's laughable at this point to even consider it ""work"". Nothing has changed in 3 years especially near the airport and on Mopac."
1373,2016,The safety of the city is most important.
1374,2016,The spending for the City Manager's Office is ridiculous!  That money could be better used in the community!
1375,2016,"The tax on homes should be based on what the owner paid for the house, not on how much the realtor could sell the house.  The  rising taxes cost/determination on my house is putting me into poverty.  My ability to support myself on my set retirement is in  serious jeopardy because of the unreasonable increases in property taxes. My mortgage is ""paid in Full.""  Now I continue to pay rent, called property tax, to continue to live in ""my house.""  The mortgage payment was fixed, taxes increase everyday and I have this slapped in my face every day.  My retirement is a fixed amount until I die. 
Please address this  systemic, out of control, evil, unkindness, money  sucking, taxing without representation on lifetime, homeowner senior citizens of Austin.   I was able/ allowed to buy the house based on my ability to pay the mortgage which we all know included the property taxes!   Now the property taxes are based on greed or should I say Systemic stealing or so called what the realtors say the property is selling for currently. The  enormous, out of control rising cost of property taxes in Austin, Texas, is sending  me into a  financial life style of poverty.

1377,2016,"THE TRAFFIC AND POPULATIONHAS BECOME DEPLORABLE, WAITING TO RFTIRE SO I CAN LEAVE"
1378,2016,THE TRAFFIC AND THE POLICE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. NOTHING BEING SOLVED AS FAR AS PROBLEMS. HIRE MORE DETECTIVES AND POLICE TO SOLVE AT LEAST SOME OF THE ISSUES.
1379,2016,The traffic flow has become ridiculous
1380,2016,The traffic is horrible
1381,2016,THE TRAFFIC ISSUE AND LACK OF LIGHT RAIL MUST BE ADDRESSED.
1382,2016,"The traffic on Cameron Road was worsened by the addition of bike lanes. Sometimes southbound traffic is solid from 51st street to north of 290! I have watched drivers go 8 or 9 blocks in the turn lane to jump ahead of traffic, and I believe I see MORE accidents than fewer."
1383,2016,"The traffic problems need to be fixed asap.  The Utility company should work with families who have unexpected family circumstances that prevent them from paying their bill.  After 20 years of on time payments, my family has hit difficult times and the utility company was not helpful in setting up late payments."
1384,2016,The traffic situation needs to be improved and not to where we are having to pay tolls!!!!
1385,2016,The trimming of city lights would ease the flow of traffic
1386,2016,The water quality is awful.
1387,2016,The way apartments and condos are being built with no money for streets and traffic. Cannot afford property taxes and rent
1388,2016,THERE ARE DRIVERS ON OUR STREETS THAT SHOULD HAVE THEIR LICENCES REDUCED WITHOUT THE OPTION TO PAY ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY TO GET OFF.
1389,2016,THERE ARE GOOD FAMILY HARD WORKING AUSTINITES WHO ARE NOT CONSERVATIVE/RELIGIOUS
1390,2016,There are many larger cities than Austin that don't have recycling.  I'm very proud of all we do here.
1391,2016,"Too many high rise buildings going in to downtown and blocking some awesome views of the capital, the stadium and Lady Bird Lake!  The addition to the Convention Center (hotel) is just one of those!"
1392,2016,"There are too many added fees in each service provided by the City of Austin. Electrical Service - $10.00 Water Service - 7.10 Wastewater Service - $10.30 Solid Waste Services $13.05 That's $40.45 per month $485.40 per year for the ""privilege"" of being a customer."
1393,2016,There is a big problem in Austin with people driving slow in the left (passing) lane. This holds up traffic tremendously. The left lane is supposed to be for passing ONLY and then people should move over. No one does this! It needs to be enforced and people need to be educated on this law. I also see people texting and driving constantly. You can spot them immediately because they drive like they are drunk. It's eradic and dangerous. This law also needs to be enforced better.
1394,2016,"There is not a good balance of growth and development, and protecting the residents who currently live in Austin neighborhoods."
1395,2016,There is too much trouble with the cops.
1396,2016,"There needs to be a stronger, better department with better follow up for victims of abuse."
1397,2016,There needs to be better and more public transportation in the city of Austin. It's almost impossible to get around without a car. His makes all of the streets and highways way too congested.
1398,2016,There should be low income apartments or subsiding duplexes available to me and other people like seniors. There is but because I have evictions they won't rent to people that's on ssi and received 753.00 a month. I will soon have to move away from Austin that I love so much. I have been living in Austin 30 years and never once got the chance to apply for housing assistance. My rent is 795. My check pays that and my ex-husband gives me the rest.
1399,2016,They are too liberal.
1400,2016,THEY NEED TO MONITOR THE AREA WHERE I LIVE
1401,2016,"They spend too much time on parks, bike trails, libraries and animal shelters.  They need to spend time on only the very important basic needs of the city like TRAFFIC, safety, Utilities planned growth and planning home and building code to move forward more energy and water conservation.  They also need to stop recruiting business to Austin.  This city can sell itself, they don't need the City of Austin promoting tax breaks for business.    I took a brief survey of my office staff while taking this and they agreed with the above suggestion."
1402,2016,Think about a grid system of streets in the greater Austin.
1403,2016,"Think GLOBALLY when considering Austin in the future.  Austin should be second to no city world-wide.  Why then, for the sake of growth, prosperity and infrastructure in general is there only ONE major freeway intersecting this fast-growing and fabulous city?  Why is there no LOOP around the city where folks can easily move around with relative ease?  City managers and leaders are to blame for the mess for which we find ourselves relative to traffic woe's.  Can you not see that the longer this issues is delayed, the more angry and frustrated our citizens become?  This  city may be considered desirable and unique, but unless the issue of traffic is seriously addressed, it will not advance to World Class status!"
1404,2016,THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND PLAN FOR AUSTIN 2050.
1405,2016,This city is becoming to costly for me to stay especially when the budget for services isn't growing.
1406,2016,"THIS CITY IS EXPENSIVE,BECAUSE THE CITY COUNCIL WASTE MONEY."
1407,2016,This city is no longer affordable due to high property taxes.  With property evaluations so high the city should do whatever possible to lower the tax rate.  Thank you for passing the air b n b license.  Living next to such a property is frustrating
1408,2016,"This city is not affordable due to horrendous tax and service fees including all city service bills - electric, water, etc."
1409,2016,This city needs more motor vehicle traffic lanes!!!
1410,2016,This is not a suggestion or anything but I think you're really cool!! I want to go into politics after college & I take inspiration from your work and all the amazing things you have done and will continue to do for our community!!
1411,2016,This is the first city in which I've lived where a feedback survey like this was conducted. This is a very positive indicator.

1419,2016,To offer more assistance in paying electric bill when it is so high during the summer and prevent disconnection.
1420,2016,"To use tax payer money to help some people live in Austin, will make it impossible for others to afford to stay."
1421,2016,TOLL ROADS DISCRIMINATE AGAINST LOW INCOME PEOPLE.
1422,2016,Too expensive!
1423,2016,Too expensive.
1424,2016,Too many city employees!
1425,2016,TOO MANY ELECTIONS
1426,2016,TOO MANY TREES AND WILDLIFE ANIMALS ARE BEING DESTROYED AND DISPLACED JUST TO BUILD MORE SUBDIVISIONS AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS.
1427,2016,Too much development is being allowed of high-rise facilities. Contributing to the traffic congestion going into the city. Development should also be away from the core of the city in order to spread out the traffic and growth.
1428,2016,TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON GENDER ISSUES.
1429,2016,TOO MUCH MONEY ON POLICEMEN. THEY DON'T HELP US. THEY TRY TO CONTROL IMMIGRANTS.
1430,2016,Too much planning/not enough maintenance.

1441,2016,Traffic and AISD problems are pushing us to consider leaving Austin.
1442,2016,"Traffic and availability of city transportation are a hot topic across the board.  Go visit Fort Collins, CO and take a look at their energy programs (now including solar panel fields) and water quality not to mention their bike lanes and trails."
1443,2016,Traffic and city planning is poorly done. It needs to be addressed for our city to continue to thrive.

1460,2016,Traffic is horrible!
1461,2016,Traffic is Horrible. Something has to be done.
1462,2016,"Traffic is hurting the quality of life in Austin since it takes away the QUANTITY of time to work or play. We need traffic solutions. I think that Police should enforce traffic laws like use of Cell Phones while driving. If people paid attention to the road, they would be better drivers."
1463,2016,"Traffic is my primary headache. Whether it is people driving too fast through my neighborhood, people not even slowing down at stop signs in my neighborhood, blaring music with the base so loud it shakes my windows at 2 in the morning, or my 12-mile commute from home to my job at UT taking me almost an hour, I rate traffic issues as my biggest concern.   A stronger police presence in my neighborhood would reduce the first three but that would necessitate hiring more police officers. I fear my other mobility issues will remain unresolved because of the City's lack of foresight and planning from the 70's-forward, making it difficult for us to ever catch up, much less get ahead of our continued growth."
1464,2016,Traffic is not fun.
1465,2016,"Traffic is out of control. I would use public transportation but it is neither cheaper, safer or faster than a car! How sad. Having been to Europe, I would pay more taxes for better public transportation."

1518,2016,WE DESPERATELY NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND BETTER TRANSIT.
1519,2016,We do not need to promote growth through tax breaks. New construction and existing corporations should relieve tax burden so that low income families are not forced out! Moving soon. Austin is getting too big and losing it's character.
1520,2017,Affordable housing for low income /working families
1521,2016,We have got to reduce our reliance on the automobile. We need light rail in the heart of the city. We need to stop requiring so much parking to make room for greater density and thus more affordable housing.
1522,2016,We love living in Austin. Thank you mayor.
1523,2016,"We MUST continue to lead the country as one of the top green cities. Gray water recycling must be implemented, and solar and renewable further incentivized."
1524,2016,"We must have mass transit and it needs to be an integrated service, i.e., buses, roads, light rail, and commuter rail."
1525,2016,"We nee a focus on transportation issues in this town, we needed it 10 years ago.  Networked Traffic lights like LA, stop building toll lanes on already congested roads and start working on other cross City roads to supplement the main highways. and more Roundabouts would do wonders to this town."
1526,2016,"We need a better mass transit system, especially Oak Hill."
1527,2016,"We need a lot more affordable housing options!!!
People are not able to afford housing and rents keep increasing although incomes are staying the same or decreasing
Landlords and property managers have too much power and renters have very little power"
1528,2016,We need a neighbor center on Braker Lane between Lamar and Kramer Lane. The seniors do not have a place. The nearest pool for this area is on far North Lamar. We need a pool too!

1532,2016,"We need an extended streetcar system (middle of all major roads). Also a fast train to San Antonio, Texas."
1533,2016,We need attention paid to east and west parts of town. Not everyone goes to/through downtown for work/school/etc. There's no reason why the best path to work should be through several neighborhoods.

1544,2016,we need more affordable housing opportunities so that we don't become a city of only wealthy people

1550,2016,We need much more affordable housing in the city.
1551,2017,1. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THE TRAFFIC 2. PLEASE DON'T DESTROY OUR NEIGHBORHOODS BY ALLOWING BIG GROWTH IN AREAS NOT DESIGNED FOR IT.
1552,2016,"We need public transportation like subways,  every Big City in Europe keep investing in public transportation under ground, we ad a lane to already congested roads, which add absolutely nothing to our transportation challenges. Only solution is investing in public transportation"
1553,2016,WE NEED TO CONSIDER TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVES
1554,2016,"We need to double down on the basics again. Ensure good traffic flow, safety, affordable housing, city planning, and cleanliness."
1555,2016,"We need to find a balance between making Austin a destination for tourism and the unique Austin quality of life.  Too many people keep moving here and ""trendy"" is fast replacing ""weird"" - the people who make this city great and eclectic and diverse are being priced out of actually living here. Plus, we are losing far too many trees and natural green spaces to construction and expansion to accommodate the influx of outsiders. It's an impossible problem, but we need to do better just the same."
1556,2016,We need to get better control of the police.
1557,2016,WE NEED TO GROW SMARTLY.
1558,2016,We need to improve the public transportation- instead of continuing to build more lanes on the freeway
1559,2017,BUILD ROADS WIDEN ROADS JUST DO IT.
1560,2016,"We need to make sure our city continues to be an example across the country for unwavering progress, with regards to energy, policing, fair housing and employment, non-discrimination policy, and creating a sound infrastructure to accommodate the city's rapid growth.  We should not become complacent in the things we have achieved but rather continue to challenge ourselves to push harder and become even better!"
1561,2016,WE NEED TO SUPPORT LOW/MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES AND KEEP THEM IN THE CITY
1562,2016,We pay way too much for water services!
1563,2016,We really need to improve our public transportation. This city is growing faster than we can keep up and it's time to get really serious about it and stop building so many downtown condos.
1564,2016,We should have unisex bathrooms. All that's needed are floor to ceiling doors. Please consider this. The gender/bathroom issue is too stupid to believe.
1565,2016,"We waited too long to acknowledge the growth and its associated issues.  I hope the assumptions for the strategic growth plan are more aggressive than in the past.  We cannot survive with only tactical solutions, and I don't have any idea what the strategic plan is."
1566,2016,We want light rail in the right corridors!
1567,2016,"We want public transportation. Gondolas, raised trains - something. Anything."
1568,2016,Wee need sidewalks.

1570,2016,We're full! Stop trying to get more people to move here! You've ruined the city!
1571,2016,What is the plan for the homeless population?
1572,2016,"When I  email City Council, no one responds to my emails.  
I am visually impaired and the lack of Uber and Lyft severely impacted my life.  I am unable to cross the major streets to go about the city as other citizens can.  I really want to see a train system in Austin that connects from Bee Cave Road and other points into downtown."
1573,2016,"When I moved to Austin city streets were clean, mowing done, water run off clean for drainage. Not so last 5/6 years."
1574,2016,"When I worked as an ER Social Worker, the Police would not approve rape kits for adolescents who were intoxicated at the time of the rape..The parents were very upset..The policemen told the parents they could pay for the rape kits themselves...I complained to police supervisor 4 times about these incidents...we need a new chief of police."
1575,2016,WHEN YOU START A ROAD PLEASE FINISH IN A TIMELY MANNER.
1576,2016,"Where are all the extra taxes we pay going? Why is the recreation center in my neighborhood neglected, why are the pool, library hours not restored? Why won't code enforcement get my neighbors to clean their yard? You get more money that ever, why are services not improving?"
1577,2016,"While I appreciate the questions that asked what the most important things are for the city to do (services to provide), that does not properly capture the areas that desperately need attention. For instance, I responded that providing safe drinking water is a top priority, but that doesn't excuse the lack of foresight with our city planning. We have grown in just the seven years I've lived here beyond the limits of our roads, human services can provide. This lack of planning will ultimately affect our safety and comfort if not addressed."
1578,2016,Whoever voted for voting by district was uninformed. City Council members should represent all citizens. The city council is not impressive. We've turned it into a partisan mess. Austin will never be the same.
1579,2016,"Whoever you are, you're doing great."
1580,2016,Why are out taxes twice than other Texas cities and city can't improve traffic flow?
1581,2016,WHY DO WE PAY TAXES WHEN WE HAVE SO MUCH MONEY COMING INTO OUR CITY.
1582,2016,Why we as home owner are no inform went you are letting group house of half house in neighborhood we are paying taxes
1583,2016,WIDEN ROADS
1584,2016,"With the widening of Frate Barker, I'd like to have the city or county put up a stone fence to protect against a vehicle crashing into my house.  Also reducing the speed limit on Frate Barker to 35mph. Already there's been a vehicle that ran into the fence last year. Once the road widens, vehicles will be driving even faster and the noise level will increase greatly."
1585,2016,"WITHOUT ADEQUATE DEPENDABLE AND CONVENIENT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ALL ROAD LANES SHOULD BE OPEN TOT HE MAJORITY OF USERS, THAT WOULD BE CARS, OT BICYCLES"

1596,2016,Worried about current infrastructure being able to support predicted growth.
1597,2016,"Would use the bus system more if it had more service in NW Austin.  Even in rush hour my trip is 20 minutes, 1 1/2 hrs on a bus."
1598,2016,Yes to a city compost program!
1599,2016,YOU AND MOST OF THE COUNCIL ARE LIARS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY.
1600,2016,"You are ruining the city with your incompetent policies and arrogance.  I'm relocating out of the city because of the overbearing nature of city council and the mayor.  Additionally, as a decision maker in my company for office growth opportunities, I have advised us not to grow our Austin office because the irrational and erratic behavior of the city council.  Fix the transportation issues.  Remove egregious regulations."
1601,2016,"You have to get tax revenue from businesses and quit squeezing the homeowner for tax revenue.  Affordable housing in this city is going the way of the dinosaurs.  the whole reason Austin is desirable is because of its formerly easy traffic, affordable housing, and the creativity and intellect of the citizens.  The citizens that make Austin weird, creative and interesting are being priced out of the city."
1602,2016,"you must address the need for improved public transportation, affordable housing"
1603,2016,You need to plan for the service personnel. They can barely survive in this city. AISD has real problems.
1604,2016,You need to take care of the homeless population in downtown Austin.  It's getting out of control and is a black eye on an otherwise great downtown experience.  Move the homeless shelter to some place outside of the immediate downtown location.
1605,2016,You need to think bigger and longer term with the major highways.  They are a mess and the small solution of adding a lane to MOPAC is not thinking big enough or fast enough.
1606,2017,1. Traffic. 2. affordable housing. 3. Youth programs.
1607,2017,Better communication with property tax service
1608,2016,"You talk as though you care about affordable housing in East Austin, but you are not following the talk with action.  You are allowing developers to tear down east Austin's affordable housing though existing policies in the name of density.  Your incentives program in the central core area are only accelerating this despicable trend.  Stop mouthing the right words, but failing to act to support those words, thereby leaving a legacy on affordable housing of which all Austinites will be ashamed."
1609,2016,"You were elected to serve your constituents, not yourself!"
1610,2016,You were very nice to favor the hurt feelings of a bitter hag native in charge of ruling on something's discourse which hadn't pertained to her in her demographic till deciding her feelings being hurt mattered more.  If it isn't broke don't fix it.
1611,2016,Your bus service is not good people have to walk miles just to get to a bus stop and you don't have a lot of side walks for people to walk on to catch a bus and that is very dangerous because people can get hit by a car. I ask you to please make your transportation services better and safer.
1612,2016,YOUR POLICY ON SHORT TERM RENTALS TOTALLY SUCKS. YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THE SHARING ECONOMY AND POLICY  OR PROGRAM THAT WOULD MAKE THE CITY AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE.
1613,2016,"Your Texas parks and wildlife warden seized our boat because our engine is thirteen years old and had no serial number. He had no reason to suspect it was stolen, yet we were given a court date and had to pay #1000 in attorneys fees to get it back. Please fix this flawed process and get your warden under control."
1614,2016,"You're in a bad spot.  The biggest problem Austin has is a lack of viable north-south arteries.  At some point you're going to have to expand I-35, possibly in a way that requires imminent domain of all the eyesore property beside the highway. The same goes for Mopac.  Unfortunately, the moment you fix the transit problem, the housing bubble will burst because people won't have to make the choice between spending an extra 10% of their income to live near work or spending 2 hours in traffic a day.  At that point, all these California trash real estate developments that have gone up in the last 5 years will rapidly fall into disrepair."
1615,2017,"1) restaurant health inspection enforced. 2) Over charging on water bill. 3) High taxes on housing and hotel rooms 4)why cyclist and bikers has more rights than motorist and most cyclist are very aggressive and do not follow road safety rules. 5) aggressive drivers breaking the laws driving slow/fast because they are using cellphones and do not obey traffic signals. 6)commercial Real estate agents never return calls when you try to call them about available properties also discriminate about on who should they lease to ,by saying we only looking for chain restaurants, or big corporations that is if they ever return your calls. 7) commercial realtors requiring small businesses to make them sign a personal guarantee which they can take your personal property if it happens your business fail like your house has to be collateral I thought that was illegal but if you do not sign papers you have no chance of renting a location . 8)local city officials must investigate how commercial realtors and Real estate agents and  owners properties illegal practice. 9) home owners associations breaking the laws by threatening home owners who wants to install solar panels or security cameras fro your family safety by putting a lean on your house. At this time I rate the city of Austin about 2 on a scale 1 to 10 that is why I am trying to move from Austin remember the saying ""what goes up fast will go down faster"" that is what is happening in Austin Texas growing to fast, greed, some unethical rules by the commercial Real estate industry and high taxes ."
1616,2017,"1.  Remove all homeless people out completely.  Stop giving them housing, food, etc.  No matter what you do, the city of Austin looks very dirty where these people hang out.  2.  No more bike lanes or medians (Triangles/flower beds).  3.  Help the retirees from the City of Austin.  4.  Stop developing land for more homes to be built and real estate properties.  We city of Austin employees/retirees need a raise."
1617,2017,"1.  There should be more 4 way stop signs and/or traffic lights in certain areas, especially close to schools.  2.  Sidewalks should be repaired, especially in lower income areas, not just high income areas."
1618,2017,"1.  Traffic control humps - Because of the new and less expensive traffic control humps put in our neighborhood, it is no longer a pleasure to drive here.  The pavement humps are understandable and workable, but these square, HARD humps are almost intolerable.  We always drive within the speed limit, but must now almost stop at each hump, to get over it.  It is wrecking our shocks, our brakes and our bodies.  It hurts.  It is so unpleasant to drive up Far West and now Mesa, that we are considering moving after 40 years!  We understand the need to control traffic, but it is a few speeders, and it seems some hefty tickets, which are also good revenue sources, would better serve the neighborhood.  We really HATE these hard humps.  Why not put in the more expensive pavement humps to help keep our neighborhoods a pleasant place to live and drive.  2.  We have one other concern about the exorbitant drainage fee.  We are older, living in a garden home community.  We have a 1000 square foot print on a very small lot.  A green belt surrounds us with lots of drainage, but we must pay the top fee because our lot is small.  We are retired.  This extra $20 a month on our utility bill for drainage, which is not a problem with the greenbelt and common areas, seem unfair.  Very unfair.  Our utility bills seems to be a line item budget for the city under the guise of odd named fees, and not really for actual services.  Thank you for listening and asking.  So appreciate it."
1619,2017,1. Make it easier to build. 2. Invest in transit
1620,2017,1. please do something about burned out house at 12320 Blue Water Drive. 2. WE need sidewalks. 3. Need a plan for flood protection for North Walnut Creek due to erosion !

1633,2017,"Actually, I can't even name the mayor, and I'm a well-educated news/politics junkie when it comes to national/international stuff. I'm sure part of that is just the nature of news these days, and I don't think that would matter much if I lived in a small town or suburb, but Austin prides itself on remaining a big (and growing!) city with a strong local identity/community. So maybe I would ask why most of my friends and I can't even name a single local government official, and what that says about community involvement/engagement."

1660,2017,Affordable rent
1661,2017,Allow CodeNext to be progressive -- stop allowing neighborhood groups to affect positive change that could come from rewriting our land development code.  Old zoning regs perpetuate socioeconomic and racial segregation.  It is a travesty that a city as progressive as ours is the most segregated large city in the United States.
1662,2017,Ambulance cost 985 for a 10 minute ride. That is absurd. Double what most cities cost.
1663,2017,"An overhaul is needed at the Child Support Office.  Just call the number and listen to the options. 1-800-252-8014 You will feel like a criminal who is a deadbeat dad, and likely will be treated like one when someone answers the phone. 
We have never paid child support late until this year for the FIRST TIME in 10 years. We switched bank accounts, had a returned check and are now required to pay an additional $26.32 each month FOR THE NEXT 8 YEARS.  
It also took TWO MONTHS to let us know our check had bounced, after that, they returned the next month's check as well. This was not good for our son's mother, really put her in a bind. This office should call or send out a letter immediately for a return check. 
I have 2 stepsons from my husband's 2 previous marriages. Another time, this office mixed up which check was supposed to go to which mother. This was also a terrible  mistake on their part.  
Also, please take a look at the pamphlets sent out by this office. They are inappropriate. It is not only men and dads who pay child support.  It is families and mothers too.
Last suggestion: Making housing closer to the city more affordable for middle income folks and families."
1664,2017,"ANOTHER PROBLEM AUSTIN CAN WORK ON IS THE HOMELESS. I HAVE EMPATHY FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE,BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM EVERYWHERE I DRIVE."

1666,2017,Are laws subjective to you?
1667,2017,"Arrest mask wearing Antifa rioters.
Arrest anyone who blocks roads while demonstrating."
1668,2017,"As a citizen, I want my fellow citizen to be law abiding and contribute to the community they live in like the majority of citizens of Austin used to be. Too much media and city council energy and funding is given to special interest groups that are the minority in the community, but have the most time to stand up in front of city council meetings and hear themselves talk and misrepresent information that is not factual. Over all I believe the intent of city management and employees is to do the best job they can for the community, but I believe we are in a storming phase with the lack of leadership in recent years with an unexperienced city council and lack of support for city civil servants.  
The special interest groups need to be held accountable, just like we hold those civil service employees who are employed with the city agencies and not be one sided as portrayed in the media. I would like every citizen treated equally, regardless of race, religion, age, sexual orientation, and/or wealth or lack there of; meaning serval things to include eliminating Austin being a sanctuary city and quit giving extra resources to special interest groups (i.e. criminals, sexually oriented persons, race, bicyclist, etc.) that only seek out and receive special provisions because of what group they are affiliated with, having little regard to negative impact it causes on their fellow citizens' concerns. I believe we are all equal in America and should not be given extra benefits for belonging too or associating with a particular interest group that someone who is not part of group does not receive. 
If things keep getting worse, I will end up leaving the city after 40+ years and retire in a environment that is inspired by community growth and commitment to one another, not one that is supporting criminals and people that do not contribute positively to the community. Austin is still weird, but getting weird in a bad way when our city politics start looking more and more like Washington D.C. or Los Angeles, CA and not the Austin, Texas I grew up in."
1669,2017,"AS A TAXPAYER (HIGH) IT WOULD BE NICE TO VISIT DOWNTOWN AT A FAIR PARKING RATE-NEED MORE SPACES-ENFORCE ALL TRAFFIC LAWS FOR THE ONES WHO RIDE BICYCLES-ALSO, RIDE ONLY ON THE STREETS WITH BIKE LANES-OUR TRAFFIC PROBLEM IS BAD ENOUGH."
1670,2017,AS AUSTIN GROWS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TRAFFIC. I THINK WE NEED AN IMPROVED PARK AND RIDE SYSTEM.
1671,2017,As great as Austin is. Can we stop encouraging people to move here.  Our cost of living is extremely high and jobs are hard to find and wages are low
1672,2017,Beautiful city - I wish the river and the streets were cleaner.  Thanks!
1673,2017,BETTER AND MORE BIKE LANES ARE NEEDED.
1674,2017,"as we welcome more and more people into Austin, I think it's important to impart to them that we care about our poor citizens, care about the homeless and celebrate diversity.  I hope that the city can put its people and its beauty and history above the whims of outside investors.  I want my neighborhood to be affordable to the families that live here even though it is near downtown.  I want our city to continue to monitor and incorporate our police force into neighborhoods because I think we've been a decent example of that in recent years but it always takes work and maintenance.  Thank you."
1675,2017,"AUSTIN IS RAPIDLY BECOMING UNAFFORDABLE AND DREADFUL TO NAVIGATE. THIS PUSHES OUT THE FOLKS WHO MAKE THE CITY INTERESTING, LEAVING ONLY AWFUL PEOPLE."
1676,2017,"Aside from the traffic of Austin getting worse each year so are the services provided for children with disabilities; everything from not having good and reliable health care services close to our community, to living in a desert of healthy, organic food area makes for raising a healthy family in Austin a great challenge that it has made us think of moving out of the city.  That's without even mentioning the rising cost of living here with how our property taxes are going up and the Austin Independent School District providing such a deplorable service in education to our children that we have had to dis-enroll them from public education and have had to home-school them.  I wish Austin kept its reputation of being a great city to be at but as the years pass we keep getting more and more disappointed in the money loving public leaders who forget who they are working for."
1677,2017,Austin Code Enforcement is virtually non existent
1678,2017,AUSTIN ENERGY IS TERRIBLE. POWER HAS GONE OUT ON MY STREET 10 TIMES IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
1679,2017,"AUSTIN ENERGY PRICES ARE OUTRAGEOUS, WE NEED COMPETITION FOR ELECTRICITY SERVICES THIS IS A MONOPOLY"
1680,2017,AUSTIN ENERGY SUCKS. Everyone knows it and experiences it and multiple friends including myself have been ripped off by them. We are SO DONE with them. Austin has THE WORST way of doing this. Only 1 company. RIDICULOUS.
1681,2017,Austin has gone through uncontrolled growth.  Infrastructure was not developed ahead of time.  Traffic speed is among the worst cities in the world (during rush hours).
1682,2017,"AUSTIN HAS GOTTEN TOO EXPENSIVE TO LIVE HERE AS A HOME OWNER, TRAFFIC IS USUALLY A NIGHTMARE AFTER RETIRING WE ARE PLANNING ON MOVING OUT OF AUSTIN"
1683,2017,"Austin highway system needs long-term though.  (In next 40 years...).  Five lanes of traffic, longer exit/entrance ramps."
1684,2017,"AUSTIN IS A GREAT CITY,BUT IT HAS MAJOR TRAFFIC PROBLEMS ON IT'S HIGHWAYS."
1685,2017,"AUSTIN IS A TRULLY GREAT CITY, I WILL NEVER LEAVE"
1686,2017,"Austin is a very expensive place to live and lots of young people, who don't have a lot of money live here. Food, places to live and childcare (I am currently expecting and have no clue how I'll afford care for my child.) are outrageous in Austin and it makes living here a huge financial struggle for anyone who isn't older and/or making a good deal of money at their jobs. For average people and young adults, living here leaves you with barely enough to get by."
1687,2017,"Austin is a very fun and beautiful city to live in. I truly enjoy and appreciate the city's efforts to conserve the city's nature and parks. Traffic is horrible, but I recognize the effort going into improving major highways and streets. I am very satisfied with the city's public and private (ridesharing) transportation services."
1688,2017,"Austin is a wonderful place to live but I really wish we had some museums. Art, science, history. We're big enough that I really feel their lack."
1689,2017,"Austin is awesome. But as the head of a small family looking to buy our first home, it is unfortunately too expensive which is why we will be moving south to Kyle at the end of the month."
1690,2017,"AUSTIN IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNAFFORDABLE, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF HOUSING. I WORRY THAT MY CHILDREN WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE IN THIS GREAT CITY."
1691,2017,"Austin is doing well making it a more walkable city, but I wish Austin was developed around the people rather than cars.  We should invest more in cycling/sidewalks which promotes a healthier and happier lifestyle, rather than investing in building bigger highways.  Look at Norway and Denmark, or even Portland.  I also really admire Austin's goal to be zero waste by 2050!"
1692,2017,"Austin is in DESPERATE need of a loop. It is a major metropolitan city. The traffic is HORRENDOUS and is bumper to bumper in all the major roads from south Austin to north. The rate of population is not keeping up with the rate of development of its roads. This is poor planning on the part of city of Austin. This negatively effects the quality of life for Austin residents, and one of the main reasons why I do not see myself staying in Austin next year. I have traveled to Lubbock TX and was able to travel from north/south Lubbock to TX Tech campus within 6 min! I have lived in Austin almost 20 yrs and have had enough. There'd no reason an Austin resident has to spend nearly 2-3 hours of their daily commute just trying to get crosstown."
1693,2017,AUSTIN IS NOT A LIVABLE CITY AND THAT'S SAD.
1694,2017,Austin is NOT an affordable place to live!! This is especially true for young minorities. This is a city of THE HAVES and THE HAVE NOTS!
1695,2017,"Austin is not managing growth well. There is too much development without the infrastructure to support it including the management of traffic flow and WATER.  Those of us in the suburbs have to watch as the wildlife flees or dies as development encroaches on habitat.  We used to run regularly in Zilker park but now it's a zoo, too many people, traffic and lack of parking makes access difficult and too many events in the park and downtown.  Those of us who have to commute dread all these events that turn Austin into the playground for the wealthy.  My escalating property taxes mean I won't vote for ANYTHING that increases them no matter how beneficial for fear of being priced out of my home by the time I retire."
1696,2017,AUSTIN IS NOT SO UNIQUE. OTHER CITIES HAVE FACED VERY SIMILAR CHALLENGES OF GROWTH IN THE PAST.
1697,2017,"Austin is one of the largest cities in the U.S., yet the mentality of many (not the mayor) seems to be that Austin is still a small college town or should remain so.  This affects transportation planning, housing, homelessness, urban planning, renewal, diversity, etc.  Austin will not be a great small city, but it could be a great large city if the various constituencies accept that things will not be what they were 30 years ago."
1698,2017,AUSTIN IS QUICKLY BECOMING A CITY WHERE AVERAGE FAMILY CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE. CONSTANT HIGH DOLLAR PROPERTIES BEING BUILT ARE DRIVING THE BLUE COLLAR WORKERS OUT OF THE CITY.
1699,2017,AUSTIN ISD RECAPTURE NEEDS TO BE FIXED! WE SHOULD NOT BE ISSUING BONDS FOR SCHOOLS WHICH WE ALREADY PAID!
1700,2017,Austin isn't what it used to be and for us original Austinites it's a change that is tough to bear. What if anything is being done to curb the influx of people from other cities/states? The changes they bring have made the city more urban than friendly in all aspects.
1701,2017,AUSTIN NATIVES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THOSE BEING PUSHED OUT OF THEIR HOMES. WHILE IT HAPPENS HOW CAN IT BE BALANCED PROCESS FROM THE INNER CITY.
1702,2017,AUSTIN NEEDS A BETTER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE MORE PEOPLE TO HELP WITH TRAFFIC AND OVERALL GROWTH OF THE CITY.

1705,2017,AUSTIN NEEDS TO DEVELOP A NEW IDENTITY MORE INLINE WITH ITS MODERN CONDITION

1713,2017,AUSTINS MAJOR PROBLEM IS VEHICULAR TRAFFIC. DON'T SACRIFICE VEHICULAR LANES FOR BICYCLE LANES AND SIDEWALKS.
1714,2017,Austin's parks are too full to operate. We need more parks. We need more infrastructure (including rail) to fit all the new residents. The city has outgrown itself. We need to think ahead about how many more residents we can fit here.
1715,2017,AUSTINS VEHICLE LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST IN THE USA IF IT EXIST AT ALL.
1716,2017,"Austin's water and wastewater rates are too high! Help keep Austin affordable by lowering these costs, since they now represent an amount equal or higher than my electric rates. I've even asked others through the country and they have lower water and wastewater bills than I do (and I'm not a big user)."

I have lived here from 600,000 population and now you want to import Mexico to take over city. STOP SANCTUARY CITY STATUS , IT IS ILLEGAL AND PROMOTES A CIVIL WAR."

There is already a statute concerning not driving the speed limit.   Also, start  enforcing no cell phone use on Mopac/City of Austin, as well.  Monday through Friday I drive from Cedar Park to downtown and back home at night, and every day I see 1 out of every 3rd driver on their phone or texting.  They are all driving under the speed limit and causing congestion at the very least.
If  tickets were issued for the above, you could use the money to build the roads, instead of taxing citizens."

1826,2017,"Cost of living is high. It is very hard for former felons to find a place to live, I have been out of trouble for over 10 years and it is still hard to find a place to live."

You're at a make-or-break point in terms of determining Austin's future for the next several decades. Do you want to be remembered as the mayor who spurred Austin into becoming a *truly* progressive city -- despite the best efforts by the faux-progressives on the city council to stymie progressive policies like upzoning predominately SF-zoned neighborhoods, or needlessly overregulating TNCs and STRs -- or the one who helped it turn into the next Silicon Valley, an enclave by the rich and for the rich, with no middle class to speak of."

1909,2017,"Familiarize yourself with economics, particularly of the Austrian variety and some praxeology.  Central planning only works well for things lacking an independent will...humans aren't chess pieces.  That's why people like me can accurately predict things like increases in traffic fatalities when you institute things like hands free cell phone bills.   At the end of the day, markets will *always* offer better, and more cost effective results than government ever can.  This is as much an immutable and empirical fact as gravity...and until you understand that, you will go on unknowingly taking actions that cost human lives."

1962,2017,FOCUS ON CORE SERVICES THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH SPENT ON NONESSENTIAL PROGRAMS THAT TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM CORE SERVICES.
1963,2017,"Focus on improvements to traffic and parking. Commute times are tedious when going from one side of town to the other considering I-35 and Mopac are the only viable options between North/South. Construction of toll roads only makes it worse by wasting public funds on private roads.  Transportation and parking in and around city center is horrendous. Texas is heavily vehicle dependent, to decrease vehicle traffic downtown there needs to be viable alternatives including transportation hubs and extended hours of service for mass transit."
1964,2017,FOCUS ON MATTERS THAT AFFECT ALL CITIZENS--ROADS/PUBLIC SAFETY. AUSTIN CITY GOVERNEMENT IS NOT MEETING THE BASIC NEEDS OF IT'S CITIZENS.

1968,2017,"Focus on roads.  Stop raising taxes.  I will leave soon to avoid taxes, esp. when I retire."
1969,2017,"Focus on the basics, first. What's the number one job of any city government? It is not to promote liberal or conservative ideas...it is to server ALL of its taxpayers, by first providing SAFETY and reliable INFRASTRUCTURE. It is absurd how simple projects, such as the Slaughter Lane extension in SE Austin is taking forever, while in McAllen, TX, they would've done it in 4 months. Here, the private sector built 2 neighborhoods, and the city can't built a half of mile of a street."

1975,2017,"For years and years, we have gone too long without a true public transportation system. The longer we wait, the harder it is. You know this. The elevated rail proposal back in the early 2000s was so close. The cost of that in today's terms is a drop in the bucket. We are wasting time. This is no city to live in when you have to DRIVE everywhere to enjoy life."
1976,2017,FORCED TO MOVE DUE TO TAXES. MOVED OUT OF AUSTIN.
1977,2017,FORCING LOWER INCOME GROUPS (WORKERS) OUT OF AUSTIN WILL DESTROY THE AMBIANCE OF THE CITY AND DRIVE STUDENTS OUT OF THE AISD. CLIMATE CHANGE SEEMS TO MAKE A DESERT OUT OF CENTRAL TEXAS. A LONG TERM WATER AVAILABILITY PLAN IS A NECESSITY.

1984,2017,"higher density housing, usable public transport, heat reflective street surfaces"
1985,2017,"Get a decent transportation system  for this city   to unclog the streets -  provide an alternative way to get to the airport   - provide a way for the youth (or people who cannot afford a car) to get around the city without having to rely on their parents, a cab or have to have a car - I am so disappointed in the priorities this city has for itself.  You have allowed all this development and not provided a sane way to deal with all the cars and people it brings.  You are no longer a small town you are a city act like one."

1987,2017,Get Austin on a computerized traffic control system - Now! Now! Now!  Anticipate - rather than react to - urban planning.  Use future development of mass transit to determine future growth patterns.

2040,2017,"Hot as hell in the summers, but I wouldn't trade it for anywhere else in the world."
2041,2017,"Housing affordability and traffic are my two main concerns.  I grew up in Austin and it's just too expensive and too crowded now, which makes it a less enjoyable place to live.  I'm not sure I can sell my home and be able to afford another home in my same neighborhood.  My day has to be scheduled around the traffic on mopac.  And all of the events that used to be fun and easy to get to (kite fest, Zilker Xmas Tree, fireworks, etc.), are overrun and too difficult to get to.  So, my family and I try to find activities elsewhere, which is a shame."
2042,2017,"Housing Affordability is the most serious issue to address.  
The poor are leaving the city to areas that that are not eligible for the City of Austin assistance.   They are getting desperate.   
There has been plenty of opportunity for the wealthy...it's time to take care of those most in need."

2053,2017,"HWY & ROAD SYSTEMS NEED IMPROVEMENT, THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC NEEDS TO MAKE SENSE, WE NEED MORE READILY AVAILABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS"
2054,2017,I absolutely LOVE the Austin public library system!
2055,2017,"I accept the changing skyline of Austin and even the hipster vibe.  But what I am having a really hard time digesting is that although I am part of the fabric of Austin; the reason so many want to call this city home, I am finding it overly difficult to afford to live here.  I work at the university in public health....a job with a great deal of emotional and service satisfaction but it cannot  compete with the income base of many of our new residents.  I want to know what the city has planned for it's long time residents that will to allow them to afford to live in the place we have always called home."
2056,2017,"I adore Austin, but I find that we are playing catch up with the city's growth. Additionally the price of living is increasing at a rate that my pay is not. I wish it was more affordable to live in the place I love so much!"
2057,2017,I AHVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR OUR MAYOR: STANDING UP FOR OUR COMMUNITY IN THESE TIMES OF GOVERNMENTAL TYRANNY. HE IS TRYING TO MAKE AUSTIN BETTER. I SAY HIS FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT FOR TEXAS!
2058,2017,I AM A TEACHER AND I CANNOT AFFORD A HOME IN AUSTIN. MY HUSBAND AND I ARE HARDWORKING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY.
2059,2017,I do a lot of walking and the sidewalks are in bad shape
2060,2017,I do not agree with multipurpose developments such as the proposed development on Bull Creek.
2061,2017,"I don't understand the low bid rules regarding city projects. It has contributed to the cut-corners style work I see happening all around the city, including no enforcement of safety laws for city workers (ex: utility men running to stop cars, no flagmen, etc.) which shows a total disregard to the hard working laborers this city claims to be invested in protecting."
2062,2017,"I am an owner of a couple of short term rental properties in town (one Type 1, in the duplex where I live, and another duplex -- Type 2 -- a block away from my home here in Duplex Nation).  I attended the hearings on the new regulations in 2016 and was disappointed in the results (particularly with regard to Type 2 properties), mainly because I believe (like many other STR owners who strictly adhere to the requirements set down by the city), that actors in good faith have been punished for the bad acts of a few.  And I absolutely believe the threat from STRs to city affordability has been overblown without any reasonable data backing it up and the STRS have been made a scapegoat for a complex problem that is more on the backs of property developers and a NIMBY-led city-wide resistance to increased density.  That said, I also absolutely oppose opening up the city to unregulated STR development like those bills the state has been considering the past session.  I felt the 3% cap worked well for Type 2 rentals at drawing a compromise between property rights and neighborhood integrity, and only failed to work where in high demand neighborhoods where unregistered STRs were allowed to operate with impunity.  Specifically, I'd like to see Type 2 rentals for good actors maintained WITH A CENSUS TRACT CAP similar to the one that was in place before the change in city regulations in 2016, but moreover, I would like the City of Austin to consider signing agreements with Airbnb, Homeaway, etc. to let them charge and pay the city hotel taxes UPFRONT, instead of leaving this to the STR owners.  As you may know, the state comptroller has recently done this with Airbnb and Airbnb now charges all Airbnb bookings in the state of Texas 6% HOT directly and pays the state on a quarterly basis.  I feel such an agreement would put all STRs on a level playing field (and would increase overall tax revenues for the city) by ensuring non-compliant STRs are forced to charge the taxes owed to the city.  I believe if the City of Austin signed these agreements with the STR booking platforms, revenues for the city would increase without needing to consider higher hotel occupancy taxes, which I understand is under consideration.  Finally, notwithstanding the STR issue that affects my family personally, I want to thank Mayor Adler for consistently taking the correct moral stance with so many of the issues facing this city; immigration, transgender issues, etc.  We are truly fortunate to have a mayor like Mr. Adler."
2063,2017,"I am appalled at the overspend, the delays, and apparent mismanagement of the new central library (downtown)."
2064,2017,I AM BEGINNING TO FEEL TRAPPED IN MY HOME BY THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION.

2066,2017,I AM CONCERNED CODENEXT IS GOING TO PRICE ME OUT OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND ALL MY FRIENDS THAT LIVE AROUND ME.
2067,2017,I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT TRAFFIC AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AUSTIN IS A OVERALL GREAT PLACE TO LIVE WORK AND RAISE A FAMILY.
2068,2017,I AM FOR STRONG LAW ENFORCEMENT. I AM STRONGLY AGAINST SANCTUARY CITIES AND PEOPLE ENTERING TEXAS AUSTIN ILLEGALLY.
2069,2017,I am in favor of red light cameras
2070,2017,I am strongly opposed to the City of Austin's failure to assist Federal Officials with the enforcement of Federal Immigration laws.
2071,2017,I AM TORN BETWEEN THE UPKEEP OF MAJOR STREETS SUCH AS E STASSNEY AND FOSTERING A CULTURE OF GOOD MANNERS BETWEEN NEIGHBORS SUCH AS NOT PLAYING LOUD MUSIC EVER IN A NEIGHBORHOOD
2072,2017,"I am upset that you campaigned promising to increase the homestead exemption to 20% to make our city more affordable, but Ellen Troxclair was the only council member to request that it be put on the agenda in June and you did not support that move."
2073,2017,"I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CODENEXT ON MY NEIGHBORHOOD. IT SEEMS TO BE WRITTEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF DEVELOPERS, NOT THE RESIDENTS WHO WANT TO MAINTAIN THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD."
2074,2017,I am very concerned that Austin is growing too fast and will lose its unique qualities and charm.  I want to be able to afford to live here.
2075,2017,"I appreciated your response to the concerned citizen expressing his distaste for Alamo Drafthouse's all-woman screening of ""Wonder Woman."" I feel like I got to hear your voice, Mayor Adler. More of that. Communication with the citizens, in all channels, is appreciated."
2076,2017,"I believe that many of the negatives about Austin (crowded streets, streets in disrepair, etc.) could be fixed with more rapid transit and with fewer people driving 1-to-a-car. I  enjoy proximity to parks but would have to drive to ride Cap Metro; yet, it would not be worth a RideShare driver's time to drive us 6 blocks to a bus stop. I understand the traffic problems are greater on MoPac and I-35 and are tied to affordable housing, but here, close-in, as is optimal, we also have access issues unless we live very near a bus route. For me to catch a bus to UT or Austin Convention Center, e.g., I'd have to drive east to S. Lamar, park, take a bus south to Ben White, catch another bus to the transit center @ South Congress, then catch a bus to UT or the Convention Center. We seriously need cross-town, east-west corridors like Cesar Chavez."
2077,2017,I believe there are many opportunities to cut costs within the City government without cutting the services.  I think these have not been addressed and that instead taxes are raised etc. when the money could be saved internally without raising taxes or creating bonds.  I also think the construction delays on Mopac have been a nightmare and unacceptable.
2078,2017,"I believe there needs to be more effort to ensure long time Austin residents don't get priced out of their homes, like the east side residents."

2081,2017,I do not desire high density in my neighborhood. (Allandale)
2082,2017,I do not feel safe in my neighborhood.  I get constantly harassed on the street.  There are no sidewalks or proper street lighting.
2083,2017,I don't really support the mayor and the city council's ideas for our city.
2084,2017,"I don't think that the city is headed in the right direction because the quality of life here is not so good as it was, too much traffic, too expensive for middle class people and low income, losing our diversity"
2085,2017,I use solar energy yes never have received a rebate from Austin energy.  Why?
2086,2017,I walk and ride the bus a lot. The sidewalks in my neighborhood are dangerous. I have to walk in the street to avoid breaking a bone or falling.
2087,2017,"I feel as though the only affordable place to live right now is in the Del Valle area, which is why I recently bought a home out there; however, I feel as though the residents of Del Valle often have to pay for Austin services but do not get any of the benefits from Austin.  There are no amenities, no shops, and no grocery stores, yet I recently heard that my property taxes may go up.  Why am I paying so much and getting so little?  Why are you taxing the poorest of your communities at the highest rate.  It might behoove you to tax those that are more wealthy and affluent.  It might behoove you to care a little more about Del Valle.   We matter too, and the community would appreciate it if you acted like we mattered."
2088,2017,I feel like the gentrification and lack of racial diversity are really a problem.
2089,2017,"I feel like the mayor cares about things I care about, but, electricity is too expensive."
2090,2017,I FEEL PRICED OUT OF BUYING A HOME IN SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A 787 ZIP CODE
2091,2017,I FEEL SAFE AND EASY TRANSPORTATION IS A REAL PROBLEM IN THIS CITY AND WE NEED TO COME UP WITH INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS.
2092,2017,"I feel that our property taxes are out of control, as well as ridiculously high utilities. I also feel that we need more bulk trash and brush pick ups. Dallas has them one a month, we only have two pick ups for each."
2093,2017,"I FEEL THE HOMELESS PROBLEM DOWNTOWN IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS BUT PANHANDLES ARE STILL EVERYWHERE, THAT IS MORE SAFETY CONCERN TRAFFIC IS NEXT"
2094,2017,I FEEL THE QUALITY OF LIFE HAS LESSENED FOR THE MAJORITY AS THE CITY BECOMES UNAFFORORDABLE FOR MOST CATERS TO THE INFLUX OF BUSINESS TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR MONEY PEOPLE TAXES COST.
2095,2017,"I guess you're trying your best, but while you're using MY tax dollars to fight for the rights of illegal aliens, did you forget about the citizens of Austin. I think that should be your first battle !!"
2096,2017,I hate toll roads with passion. Raise the gasoline tax and open up the toll roads to everyone.
2097,2017,"I have been a teacher in AISD for 10 years and cannot afford my home with a new child within the city limits, without using credit to cover some expenses. Since beginning my career here, I am making less now than I was initially, with the raising cost of insurance and the cost of living.  How is the city going to continue to keep quality teachers if they can't afford to live and raise their children within the city?"
2098,2017,"I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT FOR SEVEN YEARS TO REPAIR THE SIDEWALKS AT 4906 CARSONHILL DR. AND NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN, I HAVE EMAIL AND DOCUMENTATIONS."
2099,2017,I HAVE BEEN SO DISGUSTED WITH CITY COUNCIL'S AGENDA. IT'S WASTEFUL AND SELF-SERVING.
2100,2017,"I have had to call 311 and 911 over and over for the same problem that never seems to be taken care of.  there are a lot of people at the corner of Woodland and Burton that drink, urinate, harass people, even sleep by the shop and save store, it has become an issue that continues to grow and now be resolved.  those drinking are not fined for doing so, and the store just keeps selling them more beer.  add to it the low grade pimps and prostitutes that sit at the two bus stops and harass people, it is something that needs to be addressed, I have had to bring my dogs out to help a white lady friend of mine make her walk without issue more than once for her own safety and so she felt safe after she was harassed by multiple men.  please ask the police to do their job and help put an end to this"
2101,2017,"I have live in Austin all my life, its amazing how much its grown during this time, but please do all you can to fix the traffic concerns quickly, as well as the light at Davenport Village and 360! Thanks! :)"
2102,2017,I have waited 20 years for a real fix to the Y in Oak Hill.  They keep redoing studies and have spent a lot of money on these studies.  The continuous left lane has done little to improve the Y.  Traffic  everywhere has become ridiculous!
2103,2017,I THINK AUSTIN IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
2104,2017,"I just received a parking ticket, even though I had paid the meter and proof was hanging on my window.  How greedy is this city."
2105,2017,"I know you guys are working on it, but reducing housing costs has got to be top priority.  It's absolutely insane right now!  Thank you for all of your hard work."
2106,2017,"I LIKE THE CURRENT MAYOR, STEVE ADLER"
2107,2017,"I like your idea to harness the tourist industry dollars to pay for things like ending chronic homelessness, people expand curbside composting"
2108,2017,I look forward to Steve Adler's strong leadership.  I respect and admire him so far - I believe he has the right skill set as an attorney to guide Austin through challenging times as it grows so quickly.
2109,2017,"I love almost everything about this city, except for the trash in my neighborhood and the trash at Secret Beach. Other than that, Austin is like paradise for me. Thank you for providing a clean and beautiful landscape to hike and enjoy everyday!!!"
2110,2017,"I LOVE AUSTIN BUT IN THE NEXT 10 YRS WE GOT TO ESTABLISH A VIABLE TRANSPORTATION THAT IS NOT CITY BUS DEPENDENT, THIS CITY WILL BE UNLIVEABLE IF WE DONT'"
2111,2017,I love Austin!
2112,2017,"I LOVE AUSTIN. HOWEVER, THE TRAFFIC/TRANSPORTATION IS RIDICULOUS. WE ARE A PROGRESSIVE CITY, YET FALLING WAY BEHIND ON TRANSPORTATION. ALSO, THE COST OF LIVING IS TOO HIGH FOR THE AVERAGE INCOME. WE NEED TO BE MAKING MORE MONEY."
2113,2017,I LOVE MY CITY BUT WE MUST IMPROVE OUR ROADS AND CREATE MORE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
2114,2017,"I love the amount of bike trails, especially off-road trails.  As the city grows, my request would be to continue to focus on outdoor recreation.  It's what makes Austin, ""Austin."""
2115,2017,"I love the city of Austin and feel that its employees work very hard to maintain and improve the quality of life in our city for all people.  I feel that the city does a good job even though it seems to be continually attacked by special interests, people who do not want progress, and by conservative state legislators or other elected state officials that are working for special interests from outside our city.  I do not think our city is perfect, but I do feel that since I have lived in Austin, the city government has continually shown a desire to try and improve the quality of life in Austin and I appreciate the work you and the employees of the city do.  Thank you."
2116,2017,I LOVE THE CITY. I LOVE MY HOME IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
2117,2017,"I Love the cultural and social diversity of our city.  But, I'd like to see the city involved more directly in more veteran-related programs, charities, and fund-raisers."
2118,2017,I love the diversity.

2120,2017,"I LOVE YOU MAYOR ADLER, PLEASE PREPARE LAMAR BETWEEN 45TH ST AND 183, ITS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE! THE FACT THAT OUR TICKET MACHINES FOR THE LIGHTRAIL DON'T OFFER CHANGE, YOU CAN'T USE A CREDIT CARD TO PURCHASE TICKETS"
2121,2017,"I miss my city. I look around and see strangers. I feel like people are invading our home with no respect to the Communities that existed here before their arrival. I see my diverse neighborhood becoming White washed. There is not enough support for poor people and people of color in this city. Not enough investment is made into honoring native citizens, not enough protections are provided. In my interactions with the police, I am treated like a criminal in my own neighborhood. Police show up with their hands on their guns in front of a child's birthday party. I mistakenly rang the wrong doorbell trying to find my child's friends home. Instead of interning me I was at the wrong house the resident called the police. Luckily one officer was upset about this as I was and informed the resident they could have just talked to me. But this is the reality now. People call the cops on you for knocking on their door.  Police presence doesn't make me feel safer. More crime now due to influx of money. The city needs to get out here, be in these streets, visit the pools in a summer day, go talk to the people at ARCH, come to the Eastside where the voices of poor people and people of color are still not being heard. Stop pandering to the affluent who are taking over our policies with their own needs because they can afford to show up. We are still here; your working class communities, your starving artists, your waiters, your fast food workers, your janitors, your teachers (!), your single parents, your high school educated, your formerly convicted, we all deserve to feel safe, we all deserve access to affordable homes, affordable childcare, affordable food. The needs of the rich and the needs of the poor are not the same. We don't need boutique stores and bars. We just want community spaces where everyone feels welcome, we want police who treat us with respect, we want local government who listens and tries harder. I'm tired of all that I'm seeing. But all that being said, I really appreciate the mayor's efforts to address the housing affordability crisis. We love our libraries and our pools, when they're open (why are there no lifeguards of color? It seems the aquatics Dept. could go into the schools and recruit). I love bulky trash day and I wish recycling was weekly but I love that the city makes efforts in these areas. I think we just need to better to care for the people. Enforcing codes and criminalizing minor offenses doesn't strengthen the community, it pits people against each other. We need to be mindful of racism inherent in our city systems. We need to train our civil servants how to unlearn their own bias. I wish we had the type of community policing where people recognized police, spoke with them, felt safe with them. But we know what's going on, here and everywhere, Austin needs to be on the forefront of change. We need to be trailblazing not falling in line and you have the right kind of people to do the work here. You have very engaged citizens building movements, reach out to these people, see them as allies. Thank you for your time."
2122,2017,I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS STANCE ON A SANCTUARY CITY THANK YOU
2123,2017,"I really like to recycle but since it is only picked up every other week, sometimes it is hard to get everything to fit, even though the bin is very large. I don't know if it is cost effective to pick up recycling every week, but if it was possible, I would appreciate it and maybe others would recycle more too."
2124,2017,"I should not have to take out a 2nd mortgage to water my lawn if I choose, if that is the case and you are going to stick it to me I should be allowed to did a well."
2125,2017,I SUGGEST INCREASING BICYCLE ACCESSIBILITY ON AND OFF ROAD BY ADDING BIKE LANES AND URBAN TRAILS.
2126,2017,I support his views on Sanctuary Cities. The apartment here raise rent at every renewal and it is getting out of hand. We need rent control for the middle class as well as the poor.
2127,2017,I SUPPORT MAKING AREAS SAFER FOR PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLIST HOWEVER SOME OF THE BIKE LANES/CURBS INSTALLED DOWNTOWN MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR CARS TO EXIT WITHOUT HITTING THE BICYCLE LANE CURB UNLESS YOU MAKE A WIDE TURN INTO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE CURBS SHOULD BE CUT BACK AT PARKING GARAGE EXITS 301 CONGRESS EXIT AT 3RD ST
2128,2017,"I take pride in my home and where I live, and would like the same efforts from the City of Austin given in the lower income areas streets, roads and parks that is given to the higher income areas.  Keeping the grass cut and, maintained on the roadways and parks.  And insuring pot wholes are filled on the roads and streets."
2129,2017,I THINK IMPROVEMENTS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WOULD BE HELPFUL. MAYBE IMPROVING CAPITAL METRO. MAYBE REQUIRING BUILDINGS DOWNTOWN TO HAVE LESS PARKING.
2130,2017,"I think some major focus should be placed on restoring the diversity in Austin. Gentrification has spread throughout Austin and pushed all minorities to the outskirts. Austin was labeled the embarrassing, #1 place where more black people left a city even though it's growing at remarkable rates. It's sad to see the previous Hispanic and black community that once was disappear. Everything has been replaced with chains and the removal of any culture. Austin is no longer 'weird', it is now white."
2131,2017,"I think that department head vacancies should be replaced with existing city employees.  Why spend all this money on a recruiting firm and hire an outsider not familiar with the city.  For instance, if the interim police chief is doing a good job, promote him to the police chief position.  Also, I think we should concentrate on our green belts and trim more trees to prevent fires and electrical outages.  Also, don't take away sick time or PTO time from dedicated city employees."
2132,2017,"I think that focusing traffic efforts towards encouraging cycling and it's safety is paramount to easing congestion e.g. street lighting, signage, protected lanes etc."
2133,2017,I THINK THE CITY IS DOING A GREAT JOB MANAGING THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH. AS I GET OLDER I KNOW THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE HERE IN THE FUTURE.
2134,2017,I think the city permitting department seriously needs an overhaul. It is notorious as being an obstruction to growth and many people I know in Austin would 100% agree. I have heard many stories of people being affected negatively by this department.
2135,2017,"I think the CoA focuses on programs that help few people rather than focusing on things that will help the majority. We need to get control of the homeless situation and traffic first and foremost, and quit wasting resources on frivolous programs."
2136,2017,I think the exponential growth of Austin has had a significantly negative impact on the culture and values that this city was originally known for.  I will be moving away because of it.
2137,2017,"I think trying to find permanent residence for homeless will be an expensive failure.  For whatever reason they don't have pride of ownership and the ""residence"" will not be kept up and deteriorate rapidly"
2138,2017,I think we have coddled the Bicycle Riders enough.
2139,2017,"I THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING GROWTH--WISH WE HAD MORE MIXED NEIGHBORHOODS, MORE DIVERSITY, MORE UPWARD MOBILITY. BUT IN GENERAL, I LOVE OUR CITY"
2140,2017,"I urge the city to continue to resist efforts by the trump administration and the State legislature and Governor and Lt. Governor to make Austin an unwelcoming place for refugees, displaced persons and the LGBT community.  I am proud of Austin's leadership in being a progressive and inclusive community for all people."
2141,2017,I WANT MORE RAIL SERVICE. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN MORE NEIGHBORHOODS.
2142,2017,"I want the mayor to visit 2 places in my neighborhood as a snapshot of city services FAILING my neighborhood. Visit the Bluff Bend bridge project that hasn't been completed in 2 years (It is on YouTube, too); and visit the corner of Northcape and Middle Fiskville that is a dumping ground for wrecked cars and trash on dark streets. Where are my tax dollars at work?!"
2143,2017,"I was born and raised here.   It feels as if we are being pushed out by out of state people.  This is causing a rise in property taxes, rent and housing costs.  This was done when large out of state businesses were allowed to move here and given tax incentives.  These big businesses brought their own people hiring very limited people from Austin.  Now they are taking over east Austin, raising taxes and pushing poor Hispanic/African American people further away from Austin.  We need to get back to that small town feeling.  I do not want this city ""California""."
2144,2017,I WILL BE 75 IN 2 MONTHS. I CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE IN AUSTIN AND WILL MOVE FROM HERE THIS YEAR. SENIORS NEED DISCOUNTS IF WE ARE TO STAY.
2145,2017,I wish Austin would plan better for growth. It's a mess here.
2146,2017,I WISH FOR MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT.
2147,2017,"I wish that there were some sort of welcome packet when I moved here so I was more aware of all of these services, programs, centers, parks, etc. that you are questioning the quality of."
2148,2017,I WISH THE CITY GOVT DO MORE TO IMPROVE LOW INCOME FAMILIES/TEENS ACROSS TO QUALITY SUMMER AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS TO FURTHER PHYSICAL HEALTH ENGAGE YOUTH IN POSITIVE WAY AND IMPROVE ACADEMICS OPPORTUNITIES
2149,2017,I wish the city of Austin would put more pressure on AISD to reject the poorly written STAAR test and the prescribed way it teaches in order to make the district more attractive to skilled teachers so I don't have to teach in the suburbs.
2150,2017,I WISH THE PARKS HAD PONDS FOE WATERFOWL AND TURTLES. SOUNDS RANDOM BUT I LIVED IN ALLEN TEXAS AND IT'S PARKS WERE AMAZING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE MAYOR.
2151,2017,"I WISH TRAFFIC CONGESTION COULD BE FIXED, PROPERTY TAXES TO BE DECREASED AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING"
2152,2017,I wish we had better public transportation . I am primarily disappointed in the cities efforts to improve public transportation.  We are so far behind.
2153,2017,"I work for APH, and go to school for Criminal Justice and is trying to see what would be the easiest way to get with APD. I have done a volunteer application to volunteer with APD, and still having a hard time. I thought that being a worker with the COA for over 14 years it would be a little bit easier to transfer, but its not. I have seen older workers come in out of retirement, just to work no more than 5 - 10 years, and retire again. I have also noticed a lot of racial things, but to speak on it I feel that nothing is going to happen, so I just feel why waste my time reporting it. Its not what you know its who you know to get you the position you want."
2154,2017,I would ask that the Mayor continue to focus on providing access to affordable housing for both renters and residents wanting to buy homes.
2155,2017,I would ask the Mayor to PLEASE ask our state legislatures to focus MORE on public education finance reform than on bathroom bills.  Our children are our future and the Austin Ind. School District is struggling mightily bc of a lack of TRUE and CONCERTED attention to public school finance.  Way more citizens (children) are influenced by public education than any other single publicly funded need - give it the time and energy it deserves!!!!
2156,2017,"I would like our government to focus more on providing the essential services such as street maintenance, enabling the police by passing laws that are truly enforceable, fire, and EMS, helping those in need and less money/time on trying to solve all the little petty issues that people bring up."
2157,2017,I would like see more affordable housing. I think housing prices in Austin are getting out of control and the city needs to ensure that we have lower income housing for people.
2158,2017,"I WOULD LIKE THE MAYOR TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF LAND (TREES, ETC) THAT IS BEING SOLD TO & DESTROYED BY DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOMES/APARTMENTS. I ALSO SUGGEST THAT A TOLL OR CARPOOL LANE BE BUILT ON I-35 TO EASE TRAFFIC."
2159,2017,"I would like the Mayor to look at affordable child care for working families that are not rich, my daughter and her boyfriend have a beautiful son and a baby on the way, they are working people and can not afford daycare and feed their family"
2160,2017,I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS POPULATION-LIVING UNDER BRIDGES & PANHANDLING ON EVERY STREET CORNER
2161,2017,"I would like to let you no that side walks need to be cared for all the time and not only around the schools I have to handicap boys, one in wheelchair and one in a walker and I can't talk him walking on the sidewalk in our circle because the side walks are terrible.  I used to walk up to E. William cannon but the grass is over grown on the sidewalks I have to go down to the bike lane to get around the area. one day I did and when I went up to E. William cannon some home owner did the grass on the outside of his fence and left 3 dead snakes on the sidewalk."
2162,2017,I would like to see a law that limits Construction. A law that you must be a 10-year resident of Austin before you are allowed to build anything new within the city limits.
2163,2017,"I would like to see a more diverse population in the mid-range priced neighborhoods.  Mixed priced housing in more neighborhoods would be welcome.  I would like to see more small business present in our neighborhoods.  It would be nice if more schools were used as neighborhood centers for people to gather for different purposes.  I would like to see more programs for Austin homeless population, more housing, more health care options for them.  I don't want ICE to detain immigrants  if they are not guilty of violent offenses."
2164,2017,I would like to see more ESL classes provided by the City of Austin rather than churches.
2165,2017,I would like to see our downtown area more densely populated.
2166,2017,I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CITY OF AUSTIN EXPAND THE COMPOSTING PROGRAM TO MORE AREAS OF THE CITY.
2167,2017,I would like to see the city put more importance on making public places/businesses comply to ADA laws.  As someone in a wheelchair I find businesses do not bother to have a ramp versus steps.
2168,2017,I WOULD LIKE TO SERVE ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE.
2169,2017,I would like to share my perspective with the mayor and bring the community closer together to have a solid insight about everyone's wants and needs.
2170,2017,"I would really like to settle in Austin long-term and am interested in buying a home, but I am very concerned about the potential property tax burden. Can something be done to address these affordability issues?"
2171,2017,I'D APPRECIATE STRICTER ENFORCEMENT AND MORE REGULATION OF SHORT TERM RENTALS AND GROUP HOMES. THEY SURE CAN DESTROY ANY PEACEFUL LIVING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. THANK YOU!
2172,2017,IF POSSIBLE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT MOVE HERE UNTIL WE CAN HANDLE IT. TRAFFIC
2173,2017,"IF POSSIBLE, MAKE AUSTIN MORE AFFORDABLE FOR RETIREES."
2174,2017,IF WE HAVE BIKE LANES WHY ARE THEY ON THE STREET LIKE CARS?
2175,2017,"If you can't build new streets, AT LEAST make connecting roads so you can get from neighborhood to neighborhood if main streets are jammed...This should be for fire, medical and police services !!!!"
2176,2017,I'm a pedestrian and I just want the help from the city of Austin to keep drivers from killing me with their cars. It would be nice if you could review crosswalk safety and maybe not have walking man sign saying it's ok to walk while there 's a green light to turn left. That is NOT safe! I often have to cross I-35 by foot at overpasses and that is almost a death trap. Please help us! We pedestrians are just trying to get to work and other places just like anyone else.
2177,2017,I'M HEARING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE GETTING WORN OUT BY TRAFFIC  HASSLES AND LIVING COST AND WISH TO MOVE OUT
2178,2017,"I'M LEAVING AUSTIN. I CAN'T AFFORD A 3 BEDROOM HOUSE IN THE CITY, SO MY HUSBAND AND I ARE MOVING TO PFLUGERVILLE. ANOTHER AISD TEACHER TO PFISD."
2179,2017,"I'm very conservative in my use of electric and water usage but the fees attached to these utilities added up are higher than my actual cost of utility.
These fees are very high for consumers on fixed incomes and otherwise."
2180,2017,"I'm worried about the long-term sustainability of this city, given overcrowding. I'm particularly concerned about traffic and the water supply."
2181,2017,Imagine Austin is a great guiding document. CodeNext effort seems to be ignoring it. Accommodating rapid growth is our biggest challenge and CodeNext looks to only limit supply and access to housing. City Manager needed desperately but only if that person is able to lead and coordinate some very selfishly focused departments.
2182,2017,"Immigrants are important, they are not enemies"
2183,2017,"Impossible to park downtown, need more mass transit"
2184,2017,Improve affordable housing programs
2185,2017,IMPROVE BIKE LANES

2187,2017,IMPROVE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES PROCESS FROM PRE COMMERCIAL REVIEW THROUGH APPROVAL PROCESS.
2188,2017,IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE. SPEED UP THE PANNING PROCESS AND PERMITTING PROCESS FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION.
2189,2017,"IMPROVE MOBILITY (TRAFFIC, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION)"
2190,2017,"IMPROVE PUBLIC EDUCATION. COST OF LIVING, HOUSING & TAXES ARE TOO HIGH TO HAVE LOW RATED PUBLIC EDUCATION"
2191,2017,Improve public transportation and recycling
2192,2017,Improve public transportation.
2193,2017,IMPROVE SIDEWALKS
2194,2017,IMPROVE THE LIBRARIES! GO VISIT THE LIBRARIES IN OTHER SMALL CITIES TO SEE WHAT WE ARE MISSING OUT ON.
2195,2017,"Improve the public transportation system to the outer areas of Austin. Get some advice from larger cities like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago on how to provide safe and reliable public transportation. Stop the talk and start the action."
2196,2017,IMPROVE THE STREETS AND TRAFFIC LIGHT TIMING. NEED MORE EAST AND WEST MAIN STREETS.
2197,2017,Improve traffic
2198,2017,IMPROVE TRAFFIC
2199,2017,Improve traffic
2200,2017,Improve traffic flow
2201,2017,IMPROVE TRAFFIC. IMPROVE WATER RATES.
2202,2017,Improving public transportation rather than building larger roads would go a long way towards effectively managing growth.  Especially outside the narrow North-South corridor.
2203,2017,"In addition to all the policy work, which is great, we need a focus on better quality and cleanliness of downtown and parks spaces (trash, graffiti, smooth road repairs, etc.)"
2204,2017,Incentivize all the major businesses and UT and AISD to go to 4 day work weeks and rotate the day off the reduce traffic.
2205,2017,Increase enforcement of traffic laws.
2206,2017,"increase recycling pick up, we need as often as we need regular pick up"
2207,2017,increase supply of homes to meet demand
2208,2017,Increase the quality of garbage collection!  I am tired of retrieving my garbage cans after they have been dumped.  Most of the time they are dumped back into the street with some trash littering left in the street.
2209,2017,INFRASTRUCTURE!
2210,2017,INVEST IN A GOOD BUS SYSTEM.
2211,2017,Invest more $$ to keep arts in city's central areas.
2212,2017,INVEST OR DEVELOP COMMUTER BICYCLE WAYS THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM STREETS OR ROADWAYS USED BY MOTOR VEHICLES.
2213,2017,IS THERE ANY WAY TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAXES AND MAKE SURE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES ARE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE NO MORE TAX BREAKS AS AN INCENTIVE TO MOVE BUSINESSES HERE.
2214,2017,IT IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY THE WAY THE AUSTIN CITY BUREAUCRACY IS DOING SO LITTLE TO MAKE LIFE SUSTAINABLE FOR THE CITIZENS WHO AREN'T AT THE TOP OF THE AMERICAN MONEY WAVE. YOU WILL NEED THEM SOMEDAY WHEN ALL THE MONEY HAS BEEN OFF-SHORED.
2215,2017,"It is imperative to find a real balance between the creative class (non digital), business/ developers, and working class communities.  I fear that Austin's recent development is positioning the city to feel like Dallas.  I strongly believe the development of the South and East communities is driving the soul from our city.  
We are a family of 3 (2 adults and a baby) with a HH income of $225K.  Last night started a tearful conversation that we no longer see a viable vision for us to live in Austin (moving to the burbs does not interest us).  We are now surrounded by blah condos and overpriced tear downs starting in the mid-$600's.  As a fears political independent I am pro-growth and evolution; however, it feels that Austin is becoming a cookie cutter digital culture with little regard to the eclectic communities that relish communal uniqueness while breathing life into the city."
2216,2017,"It is not affordable. Focus on basic, safety, education, libraries"
2217,2017,IT IS THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT
2218,2017,"IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE TO LIVE HERE. THAT INCLUDES ASSISTED LIVING, NURSING HOME FOR THE ELDERLY. HOME PRICES AND RENTS CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE."
2219,2017,It is too expensive. My kids struggle to make it here due to the low rate of pay to the cost of housing.
2220,2017,IT IS VERY DISTURBING TO SEE BUSINESSES AND HOTELS BEING ALLOWED TO BUILD DOWNTOWN WITHOUT PROVIDING ADEQUATE PARKING BEING REQUIRED.
2221,2017,"It would be great if the city can finish the construction of Mopac Highway. The traffic is terrible during peak hours. 
I remember seeing a sign of ""New Mopac Highway, Coming this Fall"", and that was two or three years ago."
2222,2017,"It's not realistic to expect the average citizen to live downtown and/or walk, bike or take public transportation everywhere.  Synchronizing the traffic lights downtown, and  on major streets (Lamar, S. 1st, etc.) if you want to cut down congestion and air pollution,"
2223,2017,"It's really embarrassing that right-of ways don't get mowed, sometimes all summer. Friends from out of town ask ""What's up with that?""
Please give basic services priority."
2224,2017,"Keep some character.  Stop all of the cookie cutter, over development - we are losing quality of life - noise, pollution, traffic, tree loss.  Also - Mayor Adler promised to fix traffic light timing - hasn't happened.  This city (East Austin) is out of control - tearing everything down.  Take a breath."
2225,2017,"Keep standing up for the liberal beliefs that make Austin so great.  I'm ashamed to live in Texas, but damn proud to live in Austin. - (and yeah - we need more sidewalks)."
2226,2017,Keep up the good work
2227,2017,"I've attended several neighborhood association meetings including the recent town hall with Brentwood Neighborhood regarding the CodeNext initiative. Please do your duty as Mayor to represent the neighbors who voted for you and their interests/concerns with rezoning. Please represent the people who have been here, paid their dues, put sweat equity into creating the neighborhoods where people want to live. We are reasonable and understand change and growth is inevitable, we want smart, effective planning and zoning that works for the diverse community, not changes that only benefit developers and entitled outsiders who have no intentions of respecting or contributing to the community. Brentwood, Crestview, Allendale and surrounding neighborhoods want a place for everyone to raise kids and retire, not be pushed out by ridiculous taxes and greedy developers. Come prepared to really talk about the issues next time, your lack of answers, lukewarm support, and insistence does not build confidence or trust. One last suggestion, the next time you plan to bring in an outside firm to help with zoning, actually provide them with all the existing neighborhood plans as part of the scope of their work, this could have helped better shape the outcome, create less concern, and build trust with the community that hired you."
2228,2017,"I've lived in Austin my entire life. I would suggest that it would help the homeless population.  I worry every year about there living on the streets. I feel there should be more places for them to stay.  I know AS well as you all do that there situation is there use of alcohol and drug. I've talked to them personally and they state that the can't stay in facilities without being told what they can and can't do. Therefore, we need to come to a resolution between them and you all. In central Austin the streets are full of gravity. However in North the streets are very nice. I feel that all of Austin should be clean free of gravity. Thank you for listening to me. Have a blessed day."
2229,2017,I've never seen worse traffic planning. The city needs to stop wasting money redoing Mopac for years on end and start building a perimeter highway to divert traffic away from main city arteries.
2230,2017,"I've noticed a lot of homeless people on the streets and in some fast food establishments, wish there was a away for them to be offered some type of job or free education to help better themselves"

The quality of life has gone downhill so much in the past 5 years that I am considering moving away.  I'm tired of seeing my property taxes skyrocket year after year and me getting nothing in return.  You focus too much on feel-good programs like plastic bag bans and bike trails and don't address real problems like traffic, affordability and taxes.

I have to tell you this city is not the same, Yes, change has to happen but there is I difference between change for the better of the city, for the community, and selling out. which is what I feel that our city is doing. 
justify half a million dollars for a house in 78702 zip code. Justify remodeling south Lamar when IH35 is so messed up. See what I mean. but, No, we need to create more apartments, and run good folks out of their neighborhoods to make way for the next stupid fad that comes our way.  sell out!"

2397,2017,"My main concern the last several years is how much my property taxes have risen. I am a retired teacher on a fixed income and have begun to think I will not be able to afford to keep my house and continue to live in Austin. I have heard the mayor and city council talk about this problem, but have not seen any relief. I realize that I also have the taxes from Travis County, AISD and others that are included in my bill. I wish there was a way for the different entities to work together to balance out the hikes from year to year."
2398,2017,"My neighborhood is not safe for children because of Pit Bulls.  The City has to rid the area of these vicious animals. Children can't play in parks or ride bikes in fear of attack by these dogs. Even at Odom-grades K-5 there are people training their pit bulls on the playground.  This borders on craziness .
These dogs have to be taken off the streets.   Enact a law to make them illegal.  Favor the kids not the adults with these animals that threaten defenseless kids."
2399,2017,My only complaint is that last year I experienced computer fraud in which it appeared as if all my money was taken.  I straightened that out and followed up by calling the Fraud Department of law enforcement more than once.  They never returned my call.  When I finally got someone they insisted they had called me back.  I had not left my house and they left no message in my voice mail so I gave up.

2426,2017,"Need to promote ride sharing throughout Austin to help minimize the amount of cars on the road there an economic partnership with rideshare companies.
If Austin partnered with ride share companies in an effort to promote ride share it would result in: fewer cars on the road, fewer emissions from cars, fewer pollutants such as trash/oil/debris on roads, more jobs created, lower DWI/DUI arrests, lower traffic accident mortality rate as well as frequency of accidents, lower congestion, increase tourism numbers, improve parking downtown and at other city centers. 
The most beneficially result of increased ride share activity would be lowering the amount of time the average citizen spends in traffic which will increase the economic utility of every citizen. More efficient travel will help lower the costs to local transportation companies resulting in higher margin or lower prices."

We live in a transition neighborhood and are invested in our neighbors and their ability to afford their homes. Austin is unaffordable for many. We are lucky to be able to own our home, but we are only a paycheck away from being unable to afford to live in Austin. This is the reality of many. I believe if we had more access to affordable housing, combined with denser, greener growth Austin would become more affordable for many. The parks, trails, and people of Austin are what makes it great to live in this city. Austin is the only place I would live in Texas -- I particularly like the smell of the fresh air. We can do better for our city and that starts with limiting the amount of influence certain organizations have over city leadership. Also, traffic is terrible. It is because of the anti-growth mentality that we've waited decades to make meaningful investments in our roads an infrastructure. That is not enough. We need a mass transportation system that is not on the roads."

2453,2017,"Our cars and our neighbors cars have been hit by drunk drivers in the past several months.  In the past 3 months, 5 of our neighbors, as well as ourselves, were hit in the middle of the night between 12:30 - 3:00 a.m.
Each vehicle was totaled or pretty close to that. Our cars were parked in front of our homes on the street.  Due to the fact, they were a hit and run, we lost out and our insurance has to pay which brings our rates up.  That's not fair to us.
Not only were our cars hit, but my truck was hit by a drunk driver, resisting arrest and POM, and 2 other counts.  
The police officer wrote on a piece of paper the information of the driver who hit our truck.  The officer wrote the wrong address on the report.  I have been playing investigator because I feel the police are not helping me to get the information I need from the driver who hit my car. My car has been wrecked for 3 weeks now and it's still not fixed. 
I went downtown to buy the Police Report.  I paid for the Police Report. The report doesn't tell me anything. I went to the closest police station to my house to speak with police about the situation. They say there's nothing they can do.  Well, come on!!!!!!  Yes there is.  Although, the plates of the truck are from Mexico, the driver is from Austin, Texas. The driver, (he's borrowed this vehicle that hit my car), I believe the police need to help me go after the driver and find out if his insurance will fix my car and not only that, I have lost wages from not being able to go to work and from driving every where to get information.  I spent a week calling the police and 311. No one called me back as they said they would. I called again. I finally was transferred. Spoke to someone and was told someone would call me.  Again, no call.
My vehicle is still not fixed.  This also happened to my daughter. A vehicle hit her car while driving on an frontage road. The police showed up. 
Turns out the girl who hit my daughter was clearly at fault but didn't have insurance. Then police said that she found it and claimed she had insurance.  
My daughter submits the information to our insurance.  Turns out the girl who hit my daughter didn't have insurance. The insurance she had was not hers nor was the vin # registered to anyone in Texas but another state.   So, I feel the police are NOT THOROUGHLY CHECKING Nor are they helping to resolve situations that are occurring.
I want my truck fixed already. What is the City of Austin going to do about that.
Another situation is:  the fence between our home and the several neighbors that share our fence.  The fence is broke in so many places due to the several neighbors having a lot of dogs pushing our fence and creating holes where they'd jump through and end up in our yard.  We got so tired of complaining because no one did anything to help us. We stopped going into our back yard. Now it looks awful. The neighbors also shot fireworks and busted our kitchen window. They ran into their house and turned off their lights. We called the police. They said there was nothing they could do.  Our window is still broke almost a year later.  I don't have money to keep fixing my vehicles, my fence, my windows.  This is ridiculous!!!!!
The police or City of Austin do nothing to help us.  Yet, they take our money for whatever they can."

2455,2017,"Our family has lived in the Austin area for many years.  We lived in Round Rock for a few years because it was more affordable but then down-sized to move into the city because we hated spending so much time on the highway commuting.  While we enjoy living in Austin and the extra time our shorter commutes give our family, each year it seems to become less and less affordable for moderate income families like ours.  We would hate to move away but at the rate things are going, we will need to find additional sources of income in order to continue living here.  Both adults in our family currently have full-time jobs and we have advanced college degrees (master's level)."

Also the gentrification of East Austin that has been displacing black people needs to stop.  The city's graffiti and uniqueness is amazing and you are doing a great job of helping with that!"
2458,2017,Our previous City Manager often described Austin as America's best managed city.  Let's live up to that standard by challenging all of us to make it so.

2460,2017,OUR TAXES ARE WAY TOO HIGH. THE CITY IS EXPENSIVE FOR AN AVERAGE INCOME EARNER. I AM DISSATISFIED WITH THE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE BIKE LANES. OUR TAX DOLLARS SHOULD GO TO WIDENING OR CREATING ROADS FOR CARS.

Austin should value all of its residents, not just a select high income few.  What will Austin do when it becomes easier for teachers, firefighters, police, and other lower and middle income professionals to choose to work where they live?  Buda, Kyle, Pflugerville, etc. will benefit, but will the CEO of a tech company want to lower herself down to teach low-income kindergarteners?  I think not.  For a city so full of highly intelligent people, the lack of foresight amazes me."
2582,2017,please remove fluoride. no more convenience stores on Brodie Lane.

2591,2017,"Please stop trying to placate the new coming into Austin.     You seem to be enamored of new people moving here and new businesses moving here.      Your idea of supporting the people who have lived here for a  time seems to be adding a new committee to discuss a possible program which will lead to possible hiring or not.       Code Next is going to alter family neighborhoods.      Creating a more dense population in areas where families live and raise their children is not a way to make this a city which welcomes people.     The school district is losing students because of the actions of the city.      And losing students means losing families and that means you will soon be a very ""hip"" city.      And  when there are fewer and fewer families, and the big money making companies move on to another city which will offer them the next big tax and fees break because those gifts have run out here, eventually who will be here?
When I moved here, there were green spaces and areas that welcomed people to enjoy a program of live music or fun things for families.    Now, it appears the city is much more interested in making SXSW bigger with  more hotel dollars and more publicity.   Lets make ACL festival draw more out of towners.         So what if nearly half a year is used up setting up, having or repairing damages from some big event. 
Please start thinking about the people who live here now, and have lived here.       These are the people who have supported the employers, voted to make Austin a good place to live and provided the tax dollars.     Please do not continue to treat them as though you hold them in disdain because you have your own agenda."

It is disgraceful that you and your administration allow them to conduct socio-economic class warfare against those without cars and cannot afford to live closer to easily accessible bus routes. You proclaimed 2016 as the Year of Mobility. And the solution? Make folks put cars back road or leave town (CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE). At no point will I receive a refund on the portion of sales tax I pay that goes to Cap Metro and yet I will receive much less service moving forward. And then I get to pay for a huge mobility bond. How is that going by the way? I can't wait to vote against you in the next election, assuming I'm still able to live here."

We should not be paying taxes for low income people  to afford to build a home and expect to live downtown and afford it. We should be burding the property owners to cover the cost of those who cannot afford to own or build a home in the first place to ""help"" those.

2654,2017,"Q13 section 10 in reference to graffiti - there need to be a distinction between street art and graffiti, and there needs to be a forum for the community to protect it from investors coming in to ""clean up"" aka gentrify the neighborhood.   This city could be the next NOLA but not if you destroy the culture that built it. This same principle should be applied to Q16 affordable housing- people who have lived in houses for generations should be able to file for protected status and have a tax cap or a slowed rate on their homestead, several of my neighbors who lived here for 40 + years have been driven from their homes.. over the last 10 years I have watched characteristic houses be torn down and square modern (UGLY) - as large as possible taking up the entire lot with NO TREES - houses being built in their stead. You are allowing the character of these neighborhoods to be destroyed and driving the people who lived here for generations to be pushed out. I am a bachelor degree holding white woman living on the east side and it disgusts me, not just poor black and brown people, so start caring because I vote, you will loose the youth of this city if you don't act to protect the EAST SIDE.  More protests and bad press will follow if you continue down this road... we will not stand for it."

2669,2017,"Quit spending frivolously on idiotic programs that only serve the few and start focusing on the growth and how our public services will meet this demand (i.e. Police, Fire, EMT).  Quit getting involved in all the silly social issues such as TG, etc. and spend time running the city instead of placating a bunch of different groups that may or may not vote for you.  End our Sanctuary City policy, the ones that are being hurt the most from the criminal element in the city are the GOOD immigrant community that do, like most Austinites, go to work every day to earn a living for their family.  Instead you waste your time placating the immigrant groups without fully realizing that this policy may harm them the most.  But hey politics...well...is politics.  I liked you in the beginning, had friends on your campaign staff, others donated to your campaign, but you've done nothing but coddle the inside the 78701, 02, 03, 04 crowd.

2711,2017,"Review the management of all departments. Most are not well managed. Managers do not tell the truth and will smile as they lie to you. The city government comes first; not the welfare of the citizens. There needs to be accountability and penalties for city employees at any level to do their jobs effectively and timely.
The City of Austin needs to return to providing basic services extremely well. the City of Austin is currently involved in way too many areas/services/programs that should not be  provided by City government with tax payer dollars. The City of Austin pays too much for the quality of most of the personnel it hires; particularly in high level positions. The City places diversity above quality in hiring maters.

People go too fast, don't abide by traffic rules, I see accidents almost happen or happen regularly, drivers aren't paying attention while driving due to electronic device use, not allowing people to merge, weaving in traffic, tailgating, not using their signals, and likely driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. I think the city needs to do more public service announcements on safe driving habits and be stricter on passing driver license tests; driving is a privilege not a right."

In an ill-planned effort to make zoning in the city less complicated, you have completely up-ended residential neighborhoods and turned them into potentially overcrowded, overly expensive urban high-rise zones.  The neighborhoods will no longer be the calm, quiet single-family neighborhoods the surrounding streets were designed to serve.  Density for density's sake is extremely unwise.  In a wrong-minded effort to create ""affordable housing"", you are making all housing not only unaffordable but undesirable."

2732,2017,-Set the city's priorities based on the majority; not the loud minority and political correctness. Raising taxes to pay for homeless care...really. This city has become a haven for the homeless across the country. Not something to be proud of. Care for our

2734,2017,"Should do more about parking problems in neighborhoods that are starting to get filled up with businesses that rarely have enough parking to support their customers, leading to overflow of parking on the street.

2843,2017,"take care of our water without this no life. this is 2017 there is no reason Austin can't add safe chemicals to the water. Also police are too aggressive here, I've been pulled over in major cities never scared and abused before like in Austin"
2844,2017,take care of the homeless problem
2845,2017,TAKE SMART INNOVATIVE RISKS WITH TRANSPORTATION.
2846,2017,Take toxic fluoride out of our drinking water. Ozark is getting expensive and I can't shower in it. Have some parks that are adult parks where alcohol is allowed. Drinkers do not get to use parks but we still have to pay for them - not fair.
2847,2017,Tax the businesses moving here to the max. Austin is full and he is a traitor to Austin.
2848,2017,"Taxes are bananas here. Please stop spending so much money, I want to live here but my property taxes a making it difficult."
2849,2017,TAXES ARE TOO HIGH
2850,2017,"Taxes are too high, especially along lake Austin."
2851,2017,"TAXES ARE TOO HIGH, UTILITIES (ESP. WASTEWATER SERVICES) ARE INCORRECT, CHARGING TOO MUCH FOR NON-EXISTENT SERVICES."
2852,2017,taxes are too high.
2853,2017,Taxes are too high. City not affordable.
2854,2017,"TAXES TOO HIGH, ELECTRIC AND WATER BILL TOO HIGH FOR RETIRED PEOPLE"
2855,2017,"Teachers in the Austin/surrounding areas need to be paid higher salaries to compete with other large Texas cities like Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas.  It's hard to keep up with the rising cost of living in Austin (especially rent/housing) when our teaching job market is not as competitive salary-wise."
2856,2017,Tell detectives to do their job.
2857,2017,"TERRIBLE LACK OF PLANNING ON S. LAMAR, NO BUS PULL OFFS, NEW BUILDINGS RIGHT UP TO STREETS."
2858,2017,Thank you for all you do!
2859,2017,Thank you for city services!
2860,2017,THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AUSTIN IS BECOMING LESS DIVERSE DUE TO LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. KEEP FIGHTING.
2861,2017,"Thank you, Mayor Adler!"
2862,2017,"Thank you, Mayor Adler, for doing a great job.  You do not have an easy job.  Keep up the good work."
2863,2017,"Thanks for all the hard work. Don't care about differing views, but someone's willing to work hard for the city."
2864,2017,"That people from out of states want to own more property then they should have when families who have lived here many years are being pushed out by the thousands leaving behind legacy when their parents thru out their lives worked hard to keep their family together due to high cost of living and to much fun but not enough principals of life to live happily ever after a dream home with land we don't own put the house we bought and high cost the ones who want to invade are California New York which we will probably not be a Texas icon , due to style of homes build by California , New Your let us have our own style of Texas. That's what I think Mr. MAYOR OUR UNIQUE TEXAS STYLE WHAT WE ALL KNOW TEXAS FOR .This is what Tejas was called a friendly town but a friendly City Call the star of Texas our Capital not other city's work on this please"
2865,2017,"That this city is very far behind the times regarding transportation, its energy costs way too much, and its permitting and licensing departments are way too nice to big non-Texas corporations and far too restrictive for local startups and locally owned businesses in general."
2866,2017,The  traffic in Austin I've lived here all my life and it's horrible. Too many people moving in and our property taxes are Sky High. The next Generations to come will not be able to afford to live here.
2867,2017,The accuracy of my water usage is questionable.  I believe it isn't read or there is a huge problem.  I do everything imaginable to conserve and yet it is out of the ordinary for one person--ME.  I truly believe I am cheated!
2868,2017,THE CITY OF AUSTIN-ALONG WITH OTHER TEXAS CITIES SHOULD FILE SUIT AGAINST THE STATE OF TX OVER RECENT OVERREACHES OF THE TAX LEGISLATURE. TOTALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL
2869,2017,The apartment/house prices in and around the Austin area are ridiculous! They are outrageously priced and normal people struggle to live anywhere near Austin! The lower priced apartments are in unsafe areas and the cost for a single person/one bedroom is WAY TOO HIGH! This is NOT California and prices/cost of living should NOT be so high in comparison to the other major cities in Texas!
2870,2017,THE ARCH IS A DISGRACE FILTHY ILL MANAGED AND A EYE SORE.
2871,2017,"The ARCH needs to be moved out of downtown. I both live and own a retail business downtown and am HORRIFIED by the homeless problem at my residence and place of business. They threaten and harass me, staff and customers and steal/destroy my property WEEKLY, and the police do nothing. I witnessed a naked homeless woman assaulted in front of ARCH and the police drove right past her and ignored it. As a woman I'm scared to be alone at my business day or night."
2872,2017,"THE ARCH! LOCATING A HOMELESS SHELTER IN THE ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT IS DANGEROUS. A HIGH PERCENT OF THE ARCH RESIDENTS HAVE MENTAL / ALCOHOL ISSUES, MAKING IT UNSAFE FOR TOURISTS AND LOCALS. (AND IT IS FILTHY AROUND THERE)"
2873,2017,The Austin Public  Library is top of the line!
2874,2017,The authorities racial doctrine has been proven wrong.
2875,2017,The bridge on my street has been out for two years. I see unprecedented growth and construction all over the city. Why does it take so long to rebuild bridge?
2876,2017,THE CHARACTER OF OUR CLOSE-IN HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOODS AND DIVERSE POPULATION PROFILES IN SAME ARE BEING DESTROYED. THE CITY IS ALLOWING THIS OVERTURNING OF OUR CULTURE AND COMMUNITY IDENTITY THROUGH STATUTES THAT ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO RIDE ROUGHSHOD.
2877,2017,"THE CITY APPEARS TO BE FORCING MORE PEOPLE TO RIDE BIKES (BY THEIR TRAFFIC PLANNING), HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT WORKING AND IS MAKING TRAFFIC WORSE. THE IDEA HAS MERIT, BUT YOU CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO."
2878,2017,THE CITY COULD REALLY USE BETTER MUSEUMS. ESTABLISH A NEW MUSEUM PARK AND SOME KIND OF LONG TERM VISION FOR THE CITY.
2879,2017,The city council mainly Greg Cesar  has made my neighborhood completely unsafe. I am appalled at what he did in his part to causing the riots. I hold him Directly responsible for anything that may happen to my family as a result of the riots. He made it unsafe for me to go to work for 2 weeks because my place of employment was almost set on fire and the succeed just a few feet down the road. I expect the city council to conduct themselves more professionally than that and I expect them to keep their personal opinions and actions in their own homes so that my Safety and family isn't in Danger. It is deplorable to think that illegal aliens mean more to them than the homeowners in this city. If you have not notice the home owners in this town are people to and we deserve the safety that we pay for. I am just glad that the brave men and women of APD were not hurt in the riots as the blood of the fallen officers would be on the hands of the people who called for the riots including GREG CASAR!
2880,2017,THE CITY HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM ON I-35 & ALSO ON 183. YOU ARE MORE FOCUSED ON BIKE TRAFFIC WITH DISREGARD TO THE MAIN ISSUE
2881,2017,THE CITY HAS GROWN TO MUCH AND TO FAST. ONLY THE WEALTHY CAN LIVE HERE COMFORTABLY.
2882,2017,The city is becoming extremely unaffordable. This is a danger to everybody in the city. Especially those who have lived here a long time.
2883,2017,THE CITY IS GROWING FASTER THAN THE ROADS CAN KEEP UP. ADDING SEVERAL MULTI UNIT HOUSING PROPERTIES ON ROADS LIKE LAMAN AND BURROT COMPOUND THE SITUATION.
2884,2017,"The city is too expensive to live in for the quality of housing/rentals available.  The city gets dirtier and more crowded every year and the city employees do very little to enforce clean and safe environments within their apartment complexes.  Austin 311 helps slumlords thrive within the city, giving them ample warning that they will be visiting instead of dropping in unannounced."
2885,2017,"The city MUST do more to encourage affordable housing in the Central city and the near suburbs.  With our lack of public transportation in outlying areas, it is terribly unfair for poor and middle class workers to have to live further and further outside Austin.  We must stop building luxury developments and focus on affordable housing."
2886,2017,"The city must get growth under control and find a way to provide traffic relief. MoPac currently has morning, noon and evening rush hours that are approximately 7AM-9:30AM, 11:AM-1PM and 3:00 PM-6:30PM, respectively. This is completely unacceptable. These rush hours are similar to those of LA and D.C. and other cities with 8-10 times the population of Austin."
2887,2017,The city needs to be more diligent in emptying the garbage cans in city parks.
2888,2017,The city needs to do a better job at planning for density and how to transport people.
2889,2017,Tone down the code enforcement folks. They are not cops!
2890,2017,The city of Austin has no business providing electricity to people directly. The rest of the state deregulated electricity years ago. You should join them. I moved here from Houston where I had a choice of electricity providers and now I pay TWICE AS MUCH to heat and cool  the same size apartment!! No one living in 800 sq ft should be paying $120 a month in electric costs. SHAME ON AUSTIN!
2891,2017,THE CITY OF AUSTIN IS MORE THAN ONLY REPRESENTING DOWNTOWN BUSINESS INTERESTS AND PRESERVING THEIR STRANGLEHOLD OF REAL ESTATE VALUES.
2892,2017,The city of Austin must continue to widen and improve our city streets in order to accommodate city population growth and improve traffic flow.
2893,2017,THE CITY OF AUSTIN NEEDS TO WORK ON A RAIL TRANSPORTATION NOW. THE CITY WILL BE MASSIVE IN A FEW YEARS.
2894,2017,The middle and lower income people need more affordable housing; property taxes need to be lowered and be more equitable.
2895,2017,"The City of Austinis growing, which is great but this brings a lot of issues. One item that definitely needs reform is the noise/complaint ordnance. They are never taken serious and police never respond to these. People in my neighborhood have loud music and loud parties that go well in the late morning hours and even though people call police never show up."
2896,2017,"THE CITY PERMITTING AND INSPECTORS ARE AWFUL. THEY ARE SLOW, IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH AND MAKE LIFE A MISERY."
2897,2017,The City will be judged based on how it treats its most in need more than the what it provides for its wealthiest. Don't forget that there is a big and rising constituent base that are not and never will be homeowners here if the market continues to price us out.
2898,2017,The cost of living compared to what jobs are paying in Austin in both private and public sector are  grossly uneven.  I have lived in Austin my whole life and Austin has changed in many ways good and bad. If something doesn't change soon with traffic and the cost of living Austin wont have any low middle class worker. That class of people will stop wanting to deal with the hassle of driving 30-45 mins back and forward everyday for low wages.
2899,2017,The cost of utilities and living have made it difficult to remain in the city limits.  Traffic is a serious issue as well.
2900,2017,The crime Rate is awful
2901,2017,"The emphasis on affordability seems to be mis-placed.  If 150 people a day are moving into the Austin MSA, then we do not have an affordability problem.  The real issue is that that the people moving here make more money and are thereby wiling to spend more on housing, food, etc. than some of the current residents.  That results in displacement or gentrification.  But rather than allow that to happen, with the resulting increase in the tax base (and giving the city the opportunity to lower taxes on its remaining residents), we try to retain the lower income people in the City."
2902,2017,THE ESCALATING COST OF LIVING
2903,2017,The far left aren't the only ones living in this city!
2904,2017,THE FOCUS HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE CENTRAL PART OF THE CITY OR WEST AUSTIN. NORTHEAST AUSTIN IS ALWAYS NEGLECTED.
2905,2017,"THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF OUR CITY STREETS AND SIDEWALKS IS SUB-PAR. THE WEEDS THAT OVERGROW NEWLY INSTALLED SIDEWALKS, MEDIANS, AND PAVEMENT GIVE US A NEGATIVE IMAGE."
2906,2017,The gentrification in this city is displacing hard-working citizens who have been forced to seek livelihoods elsewhere. This separation of families is devastating and contributes to the negative atmosphere among the diverse peoples moving here and locals who were born and raised in this city. It feels like what Austin is becoming is not the Austin I used to love.
2907,2017,"THE GROVE DEVELOPMENT MAY BE A DISASTER, VERY DISAPPOINTED HOW THE DEVELOPERS DOMINATED OVER NEIGHBORHOODS, AUSTIN NEEDS MORE URBAN GREEN SPACE. HOW IS THIS NO THE GROVE FURTHER SLOW AUSTIN'S DISASTEROUS TRAFFIC ISSUES."
2908,2017,"The growth of the city has been too quick and caused many problems -- traffic, affordability, crime.  Focus should be on making the current population safe, healthy and happy instead of on $."
2909,2017,THE HIGH TAXES HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL. IT'S MAKING AUSTIN UNAFFORDABLE  FOR MIDDLE CLASS.
2910,2017,"The homeless in downtown near the bus station are becoming unbearable. It is depressing and not good for our city image. I do not mean to be cold hearted but in the years I have been here that area has become worse and worse. I do not feel safe walking through that area, especially at night. I'm sure businesses in the area must be affected. I know there will always be homeless but I believe the city needs to work to find a solution that won't leave them out in the open and will create a safer and more beautiful city."
2911,2017,TOO MANY APARTMENTS ARE BEING BUILT.
2912,2017,"The homeless population on drugs have been increasingly more aggressive and dangerous.  I've had them scream at me and my kids and badger us for money.  They stumble, fall and are passed out all around the downtown area."
2913,2017,The homeless situation is embarrassing and unsafe I work downtown and I can't even get something to eat without being harassed they are out of control. The camps under the bridges and the pan handling at every night is disgusting and an eyesore
2914,2017,"THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE, ESPECIALLY IN THE DOWNTOWN (I.E. TOURIST) AREA NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. ADDITIONALLY, COA NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF PLANNING FOR POPULATION GROWTH VIS-A-VIS TRAFFIC FLOW, ESP. ON I-35."
2915,2017,The housing costs are outrageous!
2916,2017,The light in our neighborhood is really dark which makes people feel unsafe and it's summer that means it is really hot for a walk during the daytime.
2917,2017,THE MAJOR ROADWAYS NEED TO BE IMPROVED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWING AUSTIN POPULATION RELIEVE TRAFFIC CONGESTION.
2918,2017,"The Market value salaries and wages are not increasing with the rate of increase for cost of housing and food!!  Rent and Home prices are way out of line with the market value wages.  I can get a job here, yet I can't afford to live here - there is something wrong with that picture."
2919,2017,"The mayor and council need to focus on cleaning up Austin.  Lady Bird Lake is full of trash.  Homeless are sleeping everywhere leaving HUGE amounts of trash around.  Downtown is full of aggressive homeless people on drugs, urinating in public as well as having sex in the open.  Graffiti is everywhere."
2920,2017,"The mayor is an idiot who doesn't represent all of the citizens of the city.  As with most politicians today, he only supports ""his"" beliefs and attempts to downplay and put a negative spin on anything he does not personally agree with."
2921,2017,"The mayor is doing a great job
He appears to care for all ."
2922,2017,"THE MUSIC CULTURE IN AUSTIN IS WHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE AND SPECIAL TO ME. WE MUST DO MORE TO PROTECT THIS INDUSTRY, HELP ITS VENUES/EMPLOYEES. WE ARE OVERDUE FOR AN ""AUSTIN MUSEUM OF LIVE MUSIC"" TO SHOWCASE/PROMOTE THE VENUES."
2923,2017,The need for quality affordable housing.
2924,2017,The need to work with ICE on immigration issues.
2925,2017,"The new DRAINAGE FEE is a SECOND PROPERTY TAX. The increased financial burden on our household is over $2,000 a year. We need to revert back to a flat fee. This new DRAINAGE FEE feels like another attempt to force life long Austinites out. Long time Austinites already complain about rising property taxes and property values making it harder to live here. But these new DRAINAGE FEES are coming out to be close or more than the property taxes now. This is ridiculous."
2926,2017,The only reason I have changed my mind about living here until I die is knowing that it will keep getting even hotter over the next few decades.  Some things you can't change.
2927,2017,"The only way to handle the growth is to go big and long-term with a major plan. Infrastructure is essential. There are twice as many residents as when I first became an Austinite and not one improvement has been completed in time to actually make a difference. Don't approve half solution plans that will be undersized by the time they are completed. One such effort that needs attention is our Public Transportation system, which is for all intents unusable. We need a true way of moving people between actual neighborhoods and around downtown that represents a well thought out system and respects our location (i.e. the fact that it's going to be very hot out.) This will cost more than anything we've done before but it can be done and it can be done well. Don't hedge the bet on Austin's future."
2928,2017,"The over emphasis on becoming a liberal bastion and the always increasing taxes to pay for liberal agenda items is making Austin less and less desirable. Which may be the ultimate end goal for most, but it is alienating your tax base and will eventually ruin this beautiful city. Additionally, forcing people out of their cars to use mass transit by way of awful traffic planning is wrong and misguided seeing as how the city layout is not conducive to the idea."
2929,2017,"The overall experience of affordable housing is far greater than just giving street people a place to live.  The upside benefits people, community and our city."
2930,2017,The permitting process has to be improved. It takes far too long to receive a permit.
2931,2017,The plan to expand the highways in a more efficient manner. Traffic is getting worst and worst and the expansion is not operating fast enough.
2932,2017,The police department has personally shown me in multiple occasions they are here to serve tickets not protect the people first which is part of their mission statement. To protect first and serve second.
2933,2017,"The police force is not actively engaged in the community in the South Lamar area.  They do not respond in a timely manner and nothing is done when they do.  They are very polite when they tell me they are willing to do nothing  though. Drug trade is rampant in Zilker and at Austin High with little to no consequence.   Telling a mother ""if we checked up on every person who might be selling drugs in the park we wouldn't have room in our jail"" is not a best practice for community relations.  It's the entire communities job to protect our children from drugs at school and in our parks and the police force has abdicated that responsibility. In my experience."
2934,2017,The poor and elderly are being very unserved.  Utility rates are out of sight and there is no option for low rent for someone making less than $15000. per year.
2935,2017,"The price of housing is causing the diversity in this city to drastically change. Soon, you will see a complete different city with the infrastructure the city is cultivating."
2936,2017,THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN AUSTIN IS DEGRADING BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS EPIDEMIC TO FIX TRAFFIC/ROAD CONGESTION AND THE LACK OF HOME BUILDING
2937,2017,"THE RAPID GENTRIFICATION OF EAST CENTRAL AUSTIN IS DISPLACING TOO MANY PERSON OF COLOR, MANY JOBS FOR YOUNG ADULTS PAY TOO LITTLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING"
2938,2017,The road infrastructure is very bad.
2939,2017,The rush hour traffic on city highways and major city streets needs significant improvement. A better and more widespread public transportation train system would be great.
2940,2017,"THE STATE OF TRANSPORTATION IN AUSTIN IS TERRIBLE. IT SHOULD NOT TAKE ME OVER 30 MINUTES TO DRIVE 7 MILES HOME FROM WORK, ALONG WITH MINIMAL PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. THIS, ALONG WITH PRICING OUT THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES FROM AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HEALTHCARE, WILL ALWAYS LIMIT AUSTIN'S PROGRESS TO BECOMING A MODERN CITY."
2941,2017,"THE TRAFFIC IS HORRIBLE. I MOVED NEAR ZILKER BECAUSE I LOVE THE PARK, YET WITH ACL FESTIVAL AND TRAIL OF LIGHTS, IT PREVENTS USE FROM SEPTEMBER TO CHRISTMAS."
2942,2017,"THE TRAFFIC ON THE MAJOR HIGHWAYS IS GETTING OUT OF HAND, AND BUILDING TOLL ROADS IS JUST A WAY FOR UPPER/MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTS TO AVOID IT. IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM."
2943,2017,"THE TRANSIENT POPULATION DOWN HERE ON THE CAMPUS AREA KEEP OUR NEIGHBORHOOD TRASHY YEAR ROUND, AND SCARY."
2944,2017,"The transient population is seemingly out of control. It doesn't seem to be disciplined or monitored downtown or in the outskirts. It is a constant consideration to feel safe moving around Austin and is an embarrassment to our guests.  It haunts at most traffic lights and costs the city too much to clean up after. It is a consideration to remaining a resident of this otherwise wonderful city. More publicity of the homeless programs may be the answer to educate me and the other tax payers. The population size of homeless, needy, and pan handlers must be dealt with."
2945,2017,THE TRANSPORTATION DEPT. IS OUT OF CONTROL WITH WEIRD LANE CHANGE DOWNTOWN AND AWFUL CHANGES TO CITY HALL PARKING GARAGE. THESE NEED TO CHANGE TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY.
2946,2017,THE VANDEGRIFT HIGH SCHOOL / FOUR POINTS MIDDLE SCHOOL AREA NEEDS MORE ACCESS ROADS BECAUSE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS RISK THE WAY IT CURRENTLY STANDS.
2947,2017,THE WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAM IS COOKIE CUTTER IN IS APPROACH TO CONSERVATIO
2948,2017,"THE WATERING RESTRICTIONS ARE STUPID. I KNOW BETTER THAN THE CITY ON WHICH DAY MY LAWN NEEDS WATERED. IF I REFRAIN ON MY DAY BECAUSE IT RAINED, WHY CAN'T I WATER ON A DIFFERENT DAY? NO WAY TO KNOW AHEAD OF TIME IF THE RAIN IS SUFFICIENT."
2949,2017,"THE WAY AUSTIN ENERGY CONDUCTS THEIR CHARGING LEVELS. MY WASTE WATER WAS SUPPOSE TO BE 20,000 GALLONS IN ONE MONTH I DON'T EVEN HAVE A YARD TO WATER! I CALLED AND ALL THEY WOULD DO IS PUT ME ON A PAYMENT PLAN. REFUSED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE."
2950,2017,THERE ARE CITIZENS LIVING HERE WHO WANT TO MAKE THIS CITY THE BEST IT CAN BE. STOP PANDERING TO THOSE WHO WOULD PAY TO LIVE IN A HIGH RISE THAT SITS ATOP HISTORY AND LEAVES LOW-INCOME FOLKS WITHOUT A HOME.
2951,2017,"THERE ARE MANY THINGS I'D LIKE TO SHARE, BUT I THINK LOWER INCOME FAMILIES BEING PUSHED OUT FROM EAST AUSTIN FOR DEVELOPMENT IS #1 HOUSING NEEDS TO BE AFFORDABLE, ESPECIALLY WITH HOW MANY HOMELESS PEOPLE WE HAVE WHO NEED A HOME"
2952,2017,TOO MANY EVENTS AND FESTIVALS THAT DRAW PEOPLE FROM OTHER STATES. OUR CITY CAN'T HANDLE IT. WE NEED BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOSING PRICES COST TO LIVE IN CITY ARE TOO MUCH.
2953,2017,Too many liberals are ruining this city!!
2954,2017,too many lights on loop 360
2955,2017,"There are no evidence based mental health services (http://effectivechildtherapy.org) for children and A LOT of guns in this town. This should concern every Austin citizen, especially parents whose children go to (public or private) school with these troubled children.
ATCIC and local mental health authorities do not provide best practice.
Foster children are in crisis. There is a direct pipeline from foster care to homelessness, sex trafficking, substance abuse, and jail.  These troubled adults were all traumatized children who have been failed by their families and their governments. 
""...the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; those who are in the shadows of life; the sick, the needy and the handicapped. """
2956,2017,There are only 2 genders. Male and female. I think our Mayor and Council are awful. Sanctuary cities are a disgrace to the law. It's way past time to round up criminals and get them out of here. Very dissatisfied with the job our Mayor and Council do and hope that they aren't working for us much longer. They are making our community dangerous. Very dissatisfied with the spending and waste for pet projects. Will be campaigning hard against that rat pack.
2957,2017,"There are other areas of Austin needing attention, not just downtown. Central East Austin and West Austin need more planning to grow smarter."
2958,2017,THERE IS A COMMUNITY OF TINY HOUSES FOR THE HOMELESS. WHY ISN'T THERE A COMMUNITY OF TINY HOUSES FOR SENIORS?
2959,2017,There is a large gap between the haves and the have-nots.
2960,2017,"THERE IS NO SAFE BIKE ROUTE BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE RIVER (I.E. N-S THROUGH DOWNTOWN). ALL THE ROADS WITH REASONABLE BIKE OR BIKE/BUS LANES ARE BADLY IN NEED OF RESURFACING. AS THEY ARE, LARGE HOLES AND STEEP HILLS ARE READY TO SEND A CYCLIST UNDER THE WHEELS OF A BUS."
2961,2017,THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
2962,2017,"THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE AND BETTER AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO $40K/YEAR SALARIES NOT JUST FAMILIES INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN TECH INDUSTRIES,THE SKY ROCKETING HOUSING IS OUTRAGEOUS."
2963,2017,"There needs to be more emphasis on transportation other than people driving their cars. Better and safer bike lanes, more sidewalks, covered shelters at bus stops, more buses, and a new train system. If my brother (who is in a wheel chair) can't get around without serious difficulty in the capital of Texas, there is a serious problem! Focusing on better, safer bike lanes, sidewalks and public transit benefits some of the most vulnerable members of the community. It also normalizes healthy behaviors (walking, riding bikes) instead of jumping into your car. It could also help build stronger communities."
2964,2017,"There needs to be more regulation of the traffics laws which would make the flow of traffic more effective and safe. The laws are there to help traffic flow but if they aren't enforced, it doesn't work."
2965,2017,There really needs to be more surveillance on the streets for these drug dealers that sell from their apt and make it known by neighbors....
2966,2017,There's a concern with the growth of the economic gap in the city and the growth of the militarized policing as a result of people's unfounded fears.
2967,2017,"These utility bills are growing too rapidly, please invest in our energy production or come up with more rebates for solar to help lower our bills"
2968,2017,"THEY WERE EXTREMELY HELPFUL WHEN I MOVED HERE AFTER KATRINA, AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL."
2969,2017,"THINK YOU ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SUPPORT LOW-INCOME PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY,ELDERS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE SAFE OPTIONS."
2970,2017,This is not a very child friendly city. the city cares more about DOGS
2971,2017,THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ON-LINE TO SAVE PAPER INK AND POSTAGE.

2976,2017,TO PRESERVE THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD ZONING. WE SEE TOO MANY OLD HOUSES AND TREES BEING REPLACED BY BOXES!

2978,2017,To quit giving away money to companies that don't need it.
2979,2017,Tolls
2980,2017,TOO MANY PANDERING TO MINORITY GROUPS/SPECIAL INTEREST THAT REPRESENT LESS THAN 8% OF THE POPULATION OF AUSTIN. WHAT ABOUT THE RES OF US?
2981,2017,Too much money spent on bike lanes.  Not enough affordable housing.   Too difficult to work with city on permits for residential and commercial.  We need less government control in this area
2982,2017,TOO MUCH SPEEDING ON MAJOR HIGHWAYS. SHOULD IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION IN REMOTE AREAS. POOR STREET LIGHTS IN SUBURBS.
2983,2017,Too much traffic!!  Too much development with inadequate parking and traffic accommodations.  Too many people moving here for infrastructure!  Too many bike lanes - very few bikers use them!  Austin needs to stay blue and not turn red like the state govt!!  We should be a sanctuary city and no bathroom bill!

3013,2017,TRAFFIC IS A MAJOR ISSUE CAUSES LUDICROUS COMMUTE TIMES.
3014,2017,TRAFFIC IS A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM AS YOU KNOW. PROPERTY TAXES ARE OUT OF SIGHT. THESE ISSUES EFFECT MY HOUSEHOLD.

3016,2017,"TRAFFIC, ENCOURAGING BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS TO RELOCATE TO AUSTIN WITHOUT A REALISTIC PLAN TO ACCOMMODATE THEM IS FAILURE ON BASIS PRINCIPALS OF GOVERNANCE"
3017,2017,"Traffic is an obvious problem and the current repairs on streets are horrible.  Numerous potholes and warped paving.  Manor, Airport, etc.  Attention needs to be given to ongoing maintenance.  Luckily we live in the central core and are less affected by rush hour.  However, at some point, this will detract from business development.  Part of the problem is affordable housing in the central core and like other cities is to be expected.  I would like to have a town hall with Kathy Tovo periodically to discuss these issues.  In the Mueller community this would work well and probably needs to be done by zip code, because concerns will differ in her precinct.  Ken Cauthern"
3018,2017,TRAFFIC IS AWFUL
3019,2017,Traffic is awful
3020,2017,Use community service people to pick up all the trash
3021,2017,We need to plan more for the future regarding transportation
3022,2017,traffic is awful and all of the tolls are insanely pricey so no one uses them. I know we need cash for expanding our infrastructure but more and more people are moving here and they should help provide some of the funding. I see empty lanes on toll roads all the time with crazy traffic jams on the regular lanes.  I suspect if you reduced how much those tolls were then people would be willing to pay them more often.
3023,2017,TRAFFIC IS HARMING THE AUSTIN WAY OF LIFE. I HOPE WE CAN WRANGLE THE ISSUE TOGETHER ALONG WITH THE AUSTIN METRO AREA.
3024,2017,Traffic is ridiculous....especially this mopac project.
3025,2017,Traffic is terrible and proposed solutions inadequate. Bike lanes are not the answer. Neither are toll roads.
3026,2017,"Traffic is terrible.  You all should have planned for the growth!  And to be building office buildings and residential downtown with no parking is disgraceful.  Just because you wish people not to own cars does not make it so.  You are just going to make the situation worse.  Also, the mayor is very smug."
3027,2017,Traffic is the number one pinpoint about living in this city. I know multiple people that have moved and listed traffic as one of the factors.
3028,2017,Traffic is the worst issue - though there are visible improvements underway they appear to progress extremely slowly and only on certain congested spots
3029,2017,TRAFFIC ISSUES!
3030,2017,Traffic law enforcement on MLK near campus and better protection for bike lanes near campus.  Ie: cars driving/parking in bike lanes. Keeping west campus clean.
3031,2017,"Traffic laws should be enforced, so many people drive with there cell phones and drunk drivers ."
3032,2017,traffic lights are too long 2 minutes is too long to wait on a light go to sleep and leave gaps in the flow 45 sec to 1 min is max attention span. at times (not rush hours) I sit for 1-2 minutes with no traffic
3033,2017,Traffic major issue. Limited bus service. Closest bus stop over 1 mile away and only come 1 hourly and does not go into town. Have to transfer to go most places including hospitals or medical offices
3034,2017,TRAFFIC NEEDS HELP. HIGHWAY 45 WILL MAKE MOPAC WORSE. MANY STATE LAWS ARE BAD.

It would be helpful to let people know what is offered via a newsletter sent to the homes, emails, etc.
Thanks

3085,2017,"We are pricing out diversity, whether ethnicity or socioeconomic in this town.  We are slowly, insidiously segregating.  We must decide now what Austin we want in the future.  If we support segregation we will get it and I do not want it."
3086,2017,WE ARE THE MOST SEGREGATED CITIES. WE NEED TO FACE THAT TALK ABOUT THAT ADDRESS THAT WE ABANDONED DESEGREGATION AND WE PAID A HEAVY PRICE FOR THAT.

I know y'all try to keep up downtown, but north central Austin is a huge mess - homeless camps and trash everywhere. And the homeless are getting pretty aggressive. This morning I had a guy basically humping my car at a stop light. That really crosses a line. I try to cut them all some slack, but ... Damn"
3090,2017,"We have been in our home for 20 years. In that time, we have seen prices skyrocket for homes in our area. Our property taxes are forcing us to change our plan of living in this house forever. We cannot afford it now and will be leaving Austin as soon as our child graduates from high school. We are very sad about this, but our taxes go up every year by hundreds of dollars. Soon, no one will be in our neighborhood but the Cali transplants who think paying just under a million dollars is a steal for a 50 year old home with old pipes and foundation problems. All of the original residents have left and the second wave has already started to go. People love their homes, they want to stay there, but they cannot afford it. :( What can be done?"
3091,2017,"We have been trying to get our neighborhood attended to and the City is making it difficult. We've had an abandoned house for the 17 years I've lived here; we have a vagrant community st the railroad tracks; and we have desperately been trying to keep businesses and apartments out. Who is in our side??? We are not informed when meeting times get changed, and I feel no one is our advocate. Why fight us? We're your neighbors and we want a safe, quiet place to live."
3092,2017,"We have enough libraries, parks, and bicycle lanes.  Quit proposing regulation and ideas that raise property taxes.  There should be ABSOLUTELY no need in raising property taxes with the number of people that move to Austin on a yearly basis.  If the city council can't figure out how to budget the city shouldn't suffer for it.  My family and I are looking a 5 to 10 year plan to move from Austin because we may not be able to afford Austin.  I've been in this city longer than most of the council members and that's a real shame."
3093,2017,WE HAVE GOT TO FIND A SOLUTION TO TRAFFIC. IT IS THE ONE THING THAT MIGHT DRIVE ME OUT OF THIS CITY. PLEASE TELL THE CITY MANAGER AND NOT JUST THE MAYOR.
3094,2017,We have to control housing costs.
3095,2017,WE HAVE TO HAVE MASS TRANSIT & IN ORDER TO HAVE MASS TRANSIT YOU NEED DENSITY. DENSITY ISN'T THE ISSUE WITH PEOPLE IT IS HOW IT IS DESIGNED.
3096,2017,"We love Austin, the only thing that keeps my husband and I from thinking we can live here for the rest of our lives is the quality of the public education system.  If we have children we would want a better education for them."
3097,2017,WE LOVE LIVING AND WORKING IN AUSTIN. WE EXPLORE DOWNTOWN AND EAST AUSTIN ALL THE TIME WITH OUR KIDS.
3098,2017,"We loved Austin when we arrived in 2006.  The entire feel of the city has changed, and we came from a larger city.  We will not retire in Austin due to cost increasing and services declining."
3099,2017,WE MUST BUILD A NETWORK OF GRADE-SEPARATED PASSENGER TRAINS. BUSES ARE NOT A SOLUTION; THEY'RE STUCK IN THE SAME TRAFFIC! BUILD IT IN THE CORRECT PLACE (LAMAR/GUADALUPE) AND PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR IT.
3100,2017,"We must control city population growth.  We don't have the resources to support it.  We're also losing the best of Austin--greenspace, affordable housing, a sense of community."
3101,2017,We must have parking available downtown.
3102,2017,We need  low income home
3103,2017,"WE NEED A BETTER TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM - A COMBINATION OF TRAINS AND BUSES. THERE ARE GOOD PARK-N-RIDE LOTS BUT MORE IS NEEDED WITH SAFETY IN MIND. BETTER SCHEDULING WITH CAP METRO, LESS TRANSFERS. THE NIGHT OF THE FIREWORKS, I TOOK BUS 801 TO PARK-N-RIDE, HAD TO PEDICAB TO LAVACA."
3104,2017,"We need a better transportation system. I work for the government and travel a lot around town for work and I typically spend 3-4 hours of my work day stuck in traffic!  I've lived in Austin for 16 years and I've never seen it this bad.   It doesn't matter where you are or what time of day it is,  there's traffic."
3105,2017,WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM TODAY. DESIGNATE MORE DEDICATED BUS LANES AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ROUTES AND FREQUENCY.
3106,2017,"WE NEED A METRO-STYLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IF WE ARE TO HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO MATCH OUR GROWTH. PLUS, GROWTH IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE OUR CITY. PLACE QUALITY ABOVE QUANTITY."

3108,2017,"We need a rail service, you have to step into the 21st century."
3109,2017,WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING ; TRAFFIC IS HORRIBLE AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED!
3110,2017,"We need affordable housing, child care and a livable minimum wage badly."
3111,2017,We need hazardous waste and recycling center available in North Austin and also available/open on weekends and evenings.  Todd Lane and hours only M-F are not acceptable for people who work and live north.  Bring a truck out on alternate Saturdays for drop-off locally!
3112,2017,We need infrastructure to support rapid growth
3113,2017,WE NEED MASS TRANSIT THAT WORKS.
3114,2017,"we need metro access to this community because WE DO NOT DRIVE and we use this transportation, to come Metro Access to this community. Thank you"
3115,2017,WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE. THE COST OF LIVING HERE IS FORCING OUT ANYONE WHO DOESN'T WORK AT YOUR PRECIOUS TECH COMPANIES. AND CAN WE HAVE SOME DECENT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION?
3116,2017,"We need more affordable housing for low to moderate income families/individuals.  I find myself continually being priced out of living in a city that I love.  I grew up here and would to stay here, but it looks like I will not be able to raise my child here or retire here because of the increase in rent and/or buying a home.  Saving for a down payment has been hard because rent continues to rise.  Raising a child on one income is hard enough and trying to save for a place to buy so my child will grow-up in the same community looks like a distant dream.  Soon, I will have to say goodbye to the city I grew up in, educated in (K-College), and fell in love with."
3117,2017,We need more housing for the middle folks. There is a growing number of people who make too much to qualify for low income assistance but don't make enough to comfortably live without taking away from saving habits or other necessities.
3118,2017,We need more parking spaces for ABIA.
3119,2017,"WE NEED RENT CONTROL, TRAFFIC IS A NIGHTMARE"
3120,2017,"We need to address police brutality within the police force. I shouldn't be afraid to leave my house or drive, as a resident of Austin or a citizen of the USA."
3121,2017,"We need to be more cutting edge in our approach to traffic, zoning, and affordability."
3122,2017,"We need to be more far sighted in planning infrastructure for a rapidly growing city. Providing better transportation (especially public transit), water resources, and other basic services. I worry about the rapid increase in housing costs, the lack available affordable housing within the city limits, homeless people on every corner, food deserts in low income communities. We are at a tipping point in Austin, with such amazing growth from new businesses, that we have a wonderful opportunity to address basic needs. It's time to look down the road, not just toward the next crisis."
3123,2017,"We need to focus on affordability, of housing, utilities, healthcare and childcare: I feel priced out of Austin even though I suppose I'm middle income."
3124,2017,We need to have more accessible and expansive public transit.
3125,2017,"We need to improve all our streets, both residential, major, and highways, to improve Austin traffic and commuting."
3126,2017,WE NEED TO KEEP AUSTIN AFFORDABLE FOR ALL SO WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT DIVERSITY.
3127,2017,We need to manage growth better.
3128,2017,"We need to prioritize working against the gentrification of East Austin, against SB4, towards conservation, and prioritize listening to the voices of people (especially women) of color who experience racism and discrimination, which includes actually putting what they say into action."
3129,2017,"We need to recognize that we will never build our way to affordable housing- new construction always raises rents, never lowers them, and if we want a diverse and vibrant city (and we do!) we need to actively mandate or promote the construction and preservation of affordable units."
3130,2017,"We need to slow down and catch up with ourselves. The area is reaching unaffordability even for those making a decent living. I've been here 36 years, have served as an Austin ambassador, but am looking at leaving in 3 years when our last child leaves for college."
3131,2017,"WE NEED TO STRENUOUSLY ENFORCE TRAFFIC SIGNALS. TOO MANY RED LIGHT VIOLATIONS. YELLOW LIGHTS DO NOT MEAN ""SPEED UP""!GET RED LIGHT CAMERAS."
3132,2017,WE NEED TRAFFIC SOLUTIONS.
3133,2017,We should be a sanctuary city.  Improve public transit
3134,2017,we should not be a sanctuary city. Immigrants going through legal channels to get here is not racist or discriminatory. Part of ensuring the safety of legal citizens is making sure the people that are here got here legally.
3135,2017,WE SHOULD NOT LET THE MONEY CONTROL WHO CAN LIVE HERE AND WHO CAN'T. KEEP AUSTIN AFFORDABLE.
3136,2017,"WE SPEND VERY LITTLE TIME IN AUSTIN BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC AND THE HASSELL, EVERYTHING IS CROWDED OR TOO DIFFICULT TO GET TO, WE RENT A CONDO FOR BUSINESS WHEN IN TOWN"

3141,2017,We're losing our weirdness to commercialization and the increasing cost to live here.  We're losing students and teachers because they can't afford to live here anymore.  We need more funding for education and more affordable housing!
3142,2017,"WEST CAMPUS DEVELOPMENT IS OUT OF CONTROL. IT'S ALL LUXURY HOUSING, SO NO BENEFIT TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE RICH PARENTS BANKROLLING THEIR COLLEGE HOUSING. PRICES ARE OUTRAGEOUS & CONSTANT CONSTUCTION IS MISERABLE."
3143,2017,"We've been growing rapidly for awhile now. Let's encourage bikes and public transportation by prioritizing them (improving and supporting them) over vehicle traffic, which is a major problem and only getting worse. Let's not let the property developers run away with the city and obliterate it's identity. Let's make the education system a matter of pride by equalizing the quality of education and programs, and not one of concern by quibbling over budgets."
3144,2017,"WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO  TO IMPROVE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS, WHAT AREA YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT COPS KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE"
3145,2017,WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT WATER/WASTEWATER COSTS
3146,2017,"What good does it do for anyone to fill out these questions.  Nothing ever gets done.  We have 1 lane off 183 going into I-35 & 1 lane coming from downtown on I-35 &
going on 183. Do you wonder why people are frustrated?????  The city never plans for growth.  The big wigs always think they are correct & we the public don't know anything."
3147,2017,WHATEVER HAPPENED TO CONTROLLED GROWTH?
3148,2017,"When planning the city we have to make space for art. I work with the theatre community and we have lost several spaces around town. Most places left are booked through 2018. When trying to work with local businesses, they charge crazy fees to rent their space. New buildings should have to offer artistic space along with space for businesses."
3149,2017,WHEN YOU SET OUT TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE DOING DO NOT MISREPRESENT OF YOUR DOCTRINE BUT RATHER ANY THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE. DON'T LIE TO US.
3150,2017,"WHILE AFFORDABLE HOUSING (THE LACK THEREOF) IS THE MOST OBVIOUS ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE TACKLED, SINCE I MOVED HERE, I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED CONSISTENT POOL (FREE) SERVICES AT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD POOL, SHIPE. OTHE LOCAL POOLS HAVE BEEN LACKING DUE TO INADEQUATE STAFFING & OLD EQUIPMENT. THIS IS AUSTIN, TX NOT FLINT, MICHIGAN"
3151,2017,WHOEVER MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT TRAFFIC SIGNALS IS A TOTAL RETARD. LEFT TURN ARROWS SHOULD BE BANNED
3152,2017,Why are my ethnic groups interest ignored?(Caucasian)
3153,2017,"Why are so many perfectly good city streets allowed to be torn up by contractors, who then do not return them to the same condition they were before doing their work? After such work, all over the city, so many streets are nearly like streets you'd expect to drive in a third world country. Try cruising around Powell Circle in south Austin to experience a prime example. The Streets Department is completely negligent in their enforcing their demands that contractors must return streets to their original condition after performing work. It's a disgrace. I have to get in a second comment: get rid of this ridiculous short term rental nonsense. Time after time after time after time - for years - we've had to call 3-1-1 in the middle of the night to complain about noise from a neighbor who rents out his duplex and nothing ever changes. If I wanted to live behind a hotel I wouldn't have bought a house in this neighborhood."
3154,2017,WHY ARE THE BUS STOPS NOT MORE MODIFIED FOR USERS? COVERS TO BLOCK THE SUN AND BENCHES TO SIT ON.
3155,2017,ZONING IN THE EAST AUSTIN AREA/PROPERTY TAXES (SAVES THESE PEOPLE HOMES) POLICE ETHICS
3156,2017,"why are you allowing so many condo and apartment buildings to be built downtown, but not improve the highways and roads throughout the Austin area ?
I feel the roads in the city and all the highways are 20 years behind and are going to continue to fall even further with population growing at a crazy rate !!!"
3157,2017,Why are you in agreement with making our city suffer and bringing back racism?
3158,2017,Why did you build the $200M Library ?   I still can't get the books I want to read. I have no desire to commute to a beautiful downtown edifice and drink a $5 Starbucks coffee when I can't get the book I want to read. That money would have been much better spent on getting more reading materials and making them electronically available so I can lie in my hammock drinking a 5 cent lemonade and reading what I want to read because it is easily electronically available. This is just one example of the way CoA is out-of-touch with the working tax-paying citizen. We don't want a Library Palace for $200 million...we want access to reading materials...!
3159,2017,Why does it take so long to have a permit to create jobs?
3160,2017,"Why don't you care!  Too many things to write.  Just to mention a couple here:  Teachers are not held accountable!  Because AISD is struggling, many residents are now sending their kids to charter schools where there is more accountability and expectations.  The roads are joke!  Lets not even discuss that.  The recreation centers need more funding.  It is sad when you go see your kids play sports and the bleachers are all broken and dangerous.  I guess the city is waiting for a law suit before they repair or replace.  Again, too many issues to discuss..."
3161,2017,WHY HASN'T THE CITY PURSUSED A QUIET ZONE ALONG 5TH ST.
3162,2017,WHY IS A TOLL ROAD ON MOPAC THE SOLUTION? I'M PAYING TAXES 101 IS FOR ROADS AND NOW I HAVE TO PAY ON TOP OF THAT.
3163,2017,widen Brodie Lane and upkeep as needed (paving)
3164,2017,With increasing traffic in the roads and in neighborhoods I would like to see more enforcement of speed limits .
3165,2017,"WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST PROPERTY TAXES IN THE STATE, AUSTIN HAS THE WORST TRAFFIC. THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SINGLE ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THAT IS FREE TO CITIZENS IN THE LAST 16 YEARS. COMPARED TO OTHER CITIES, AUSTIN HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT (MILES PER CAPITA) OF FREEWAY IN THE STATE. THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE PREVIOUS ONE HAS RUINED THE BEAUTY OF THE CITY BY ALLOWING COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE LANDSCAPE."

3180,2017,YOU ARE DOING A GOOD JOB
3181,2017,YOU ARE VERY VISIBLE AND HAVE OUR INTEREST AT HEART. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
3182,2017,You can't make affordable housing by subsidy.
3183,2017,YOU MUST DO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE TO DEAL WITH THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM IN AUSTIN. CONVERTING TRAVEL LANES TO BIKE LANES IS NOT THE ANSWER. IT IS WISHFUL THINKING THAT GETS NOWHERE.
3184,2017,You need more housing options for felons. There is a halfway house in delvalley and no where for the people living there to go except the streets. And the few apartments that do except felons are crappy and the land lords don't do anything to keep them up.
3185,2017,You put bike lanes on streets where no one rides bikes in the streets; you put toll lanes on roads that already are paid for; you keep approving the building of high density buildings (apartments/office buildings) when we can't support the existing traffic and utility needs; it seems common sense has left the building.
3186,2017,"You to need to pay teachers better.  This city is too expensive to live in on the salaries that teachers are getting paid.  
Austin Electric company is a monopoly who treats their customers terrible.  My $200 deposit is being held hostage by the company over rules that only the company has access to."
